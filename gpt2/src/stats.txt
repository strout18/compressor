8,0,21,Frederick was the son,1,0,6, Crown,1,0,29, Frederick William of Prussia,1,0,37, his wife, Sophia Dorothea of Hanover,1,0,7, He was,1,0,9, sometime,1,0,12, 11 and 12 p,3,0,49, on 24 January 1712 in the Berlin City Palace and,1,0,106, baptised with the single name Friedrich by Benjamin Ursinus von Bär on 31 January. The birth was welcomed,1,0,74, his grandfather, Frederick I, as his two previous grandsons had both died,1,0,24, infancy. With the death,1,0,12, Frederick I,1,0,5, 1713,1,0,80, his son Frederick William I became King in Prussia, thus making young Frederick,1,0,6, crown,1,0,100,. Frederick had nine siblings who lived to adulthood. He had six sisters. The eldest was Wilhelmine,,1,0,7, became,1,0,84, closest sibling. He also had three younger brothers, including Augustus William and,1,0,38,. The new king wished for his children,1,0,28, be educated not as royalty,,2,0,7, simple,1,0,19,. They were tutored,1,0,36, a French woman, Madame de Montbail,,1,0,38, had also educated Frederick William.
,1,0,9,Frederick,1,0,38, I, popularly dubbed the "Soldier King,1,0,33, had created a large and powerful,1,0,25, that included a regiment,1,0,59, his famous "Potsdam Giants", carefully managed the kingdom,1,0,84, wealth, and developed a strong centralised government. He also had a violent temper,1,0,40, ruled Brandenburg-Prussia with absolute,1,0,68,. In contrast, Frederick's mother Sophia, whose father, George Louis,1,0,19, Brunswick-Lüneburg,1,0,29, had succeeded to the British,1,0,8, as King,1,0,2, I,1,0,30, 1714, was polite, charismatic,1,0,48, learned. The political and personal differences,1,0,12, Frederick's,1,0,43, created tensions, which impacted Frederick,1,0,9, attitude,1,0,9, his role,1,0,22, a ruler, his attitude,1,0,13, culture, and,1,0,13, relationship,2,0,9, father.
,1,0,6,During,1,0,12, early youth,1,0,16, Frederick lived,2,0,7, mother,2,0,21, Wilhelmine, although,1,0,31, regularly visited their father,1,0,8, hunting,1,0,84, at Königs Wusterhausen. Frederick and his older sister formed a close relationship,,1,0,17, lasted until her,2,0,5, 1758,1,0,31, Frederick and his sisters were,2,0,79, by a Huguenot governess and tutor and learned French and German simultaneously,1,0,9, In spite,1,0,11, his father,1,0,12, desire that,1,0,32, education be entirely religious,1,0,54, pragmatic, the young Frederick developed a preference,1,0,114, music, literature, and French culture. Frederick Wilhelm thought these interests were effeminate, as they clashed,1,0,26, his militarism, resulting,2,0,60, frequent beating and humiliation of Frederick. Nevertheless,1,0,25, Frederick, with the help,2,0,108, tutor in Latin, Jacques Duhan, procured for himself a three thousand volume secret library of poetry, Greek,1,0,68, Roman classics, and philosophy to supplement his official lessons.
,1,0,40,Although his father, Frederick William I,2,0,33, been raised a Calvinist in spite,1,0,25, the Lutheran state faith,1,0,34, Prussia, he feared he was not one,1,0,4, God,1,0,32, elect. To avoid the possibility,1,0,34, his son Frederick being motivated,1,0,64, the same concerns, the king ordered that his heir not be taught,1,0,25, predestination. In spite,1,0,11, his father,1,0,33, intention, Frederick appeared to,1,0,16, adopted a sense,1,0,28, predestination for himself.,

8,0,54,In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave,1,0,40, some advice that I've been turning over,2,0,10, mind ever,1,0,2,.
,1,0,9,"Whenever,1,0,5, feel,1,0,49, criticizing any one," he told me, "just remember,1,0,35, all the people in this world haven,1,0,37, had the advantages that you've had.",2,0,7,He didn,1,0,21, say any more, but we,1,0,94, always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great,1,0,5, more,1,0,5, that,1,0,18, In consequence, I,1,0,9, inclined,1,0,47, reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened,1,0,41, many curious natures to me and also made,1,0,11, the victim,1,0,52, not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick,1,0,25, detect and attach itself,1,0,70, this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about,1,0,34, in college I was unjustly accused,1,0,40, being a politician, because I was privy,1,0,45, the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most,1,0,16, the confidences,1,0,58, unsought--frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation,,1,0,59, a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign,1,0,102, an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at,1,0,13, the terms in,2,0,39, express them, are usually plagiaristic,1,0,7, marred,1,0,54, obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter,1,0,149, infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense,1,0,39, the fundamental decencies is parcelled,1,0,21, unequally at birth.
,1,0,69,And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission,1,0,76, it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes,,1,0,28, after a certain point I don,1,0,5, care,1,0,13, it's founded,2,0,12, When I came,2,0,52, the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world,1,0,28, be in uniform and at a sort,1,0,91, moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into,1,0,34, human heart. Only Gatsby, the man,1,0,10, gives his,1,0,3, to,1,0,17, book, was exempt,1,0,123, my reaction--Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series,1,0,55, successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous,1,0,80, him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related,1,0,4, one,1,0,25, those intricate machines,1,0,40, register earthquakes ten thousand miles,1,0,1,.,1,0,27, responsiveness had nothing,3,0,64, that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name,1,0,32, the "creative temperament."--it,1,0,58, an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such,1,0,26, I have never found in any,1,0,42, person and which it is not likely I shall,2,0,33, again. No--Gatsby turned out all,1,0,76, at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake,1,0,51, his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest,1,0,56, the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.
,1,0,38,My family have been prominent, well-to,2,0,89, people in this Middle Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of,1,0,51, clan, and we have a tradition that we're descended,1,0,10, the Dukes,1,0,34, Buccleuch, but the actual founder,1,0,38, my line was my grandfather's brother,,1,0,104, came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business,1,0,25, my father carries on to-,1,0,48,. I never saw this great-uncle, but I'm supposed,1,0,38, look like him--with special reference,1,0,32, the rather hard-boiled painting,1,0,16, hangs in father,1,0,19, office I graduated,1,0,34, New Haven in 1915, just a quarter,1,0,2, a,1,0,30, after my father, and a little,1,0,15, I participated,1,0,38, that delayed Teutonic migration known,2,0,10, Great War,1,0,41, I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly,1,0,7, I came,1,0,18, restless. Instead,1,0,22, being the warm centre,1,0,38, the world, the Middle West now seemed,2,0,12, ragged edge,1,0,4, the,1,0,14,--so I decided,1,0,8, go East,1,0,82, learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed,1,0,18, could support one,1,0,46, single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it,1,0,6, as if,1,0,101, were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, "Why--ye--es," with very grave, hesitant faces,1,0,67, Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I,1,0,44, East, permanently, I thought, in the spring,1,0,7, twenty,1,0,5,two.
,1,0,120,The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns,1,0,122, friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded,1,0,8, a great,1,0,92,. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last,1,0,21, the firm ordered him,1,0,23, Washington, and I went,1,0,38, to the country alone. I had a dog--at,1,0,31, I had him for a few days until,1,0,48, ran away--and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman,,1,0,98, made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.
,1,0,101,It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on,1,0,7, road.
,1,0,7,"How do,1,0,29, get to West Egg village?" he,1,0,11, helplessly,1,0,1,
,1,0,6,I told,1,0,138,. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom,1,0,19, the neighborhood.
,1,0,45,And so with the sunshine and the great bursts,1,0,96, leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction,1,0,5, life,1,0,15, beginning over,1,0,18, with the summer.
,1,0,12,There was so,1,0,17, to read, for one,1,0,47,, and so much fine health to be pulled down out,1,0,65, the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking,1,0,222, credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention,1,0,174, reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college--one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the "Yale News."--and now I was going,1,0,35, bring back all such things into my,2,0,61, become again that most limited of all specialists, the "well,1,0,13,rounded man.",1,0,4, isn,2,0,85, an epigram--life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all,1,0,1,
,1,0,15,It was a matter,1,0,7, chance,1,0,23, I should have rented a,1,0,7, in one,1,0,26, the strangest communities,1,0,6, North,1,0,4,. It,1,0,90, on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York--and where there,1,0,33,, among other natural curiosities,1,0,66, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair,1,0,25, enormous eggs, identical,1,0,8, contour,1,0,15, separated only,1,0,29, a courtesy bay, jut out into,1,0,40, most domesticated body of salt water in,1,0,51, Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long,1,0,51, Sound. they are not perfect ovals--like the egg in,1,0,46, Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at,1,0,14, contact end--,1,0,44, their physical resemblance must be a source,1,0,152, perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. to the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape,1,0,5, size,1,0,1,
,1,0,30,I lived at West Egg, the--well,1,0,28, the less fashionable of the,1,0,120,, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. my house,1,0,16, at the very tip,1,0,31, the egg, only fifty yards from,1,0,183, Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. the one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard--it was a factual imitation,1,0,49, some Hotel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on,2,0,67,, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming,1,0,10,, and more,1,0,12, forty acres,1,0,5, lawn,1,0,44, garden. it was Gatsby's mansion. Or, rather,1,0,10, as I didn,1,0,8, know Mr,1,0,35, Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited,1,0,39, a gentleman of that name. My own house,1,0,12, an eyesore,,1,0,52, it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked,,1,0,37, I had a view of the water, a partial,2,0,12, my neighbor,1,0,34, lawn, and the consoling proximity,1,0,39, millionaires--all for eighty dollars a,1,0,2,.
,1,0,6,Across,1,0,71, courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along,1,0,23, water, and the history,1,0,67, the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have,2,0,90, the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I'd known Tom in college.,1,0,59, just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.
,1,0,51,Her husband, among various physical accomplishments,2,0,9, been one,2,0,202, most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven--a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti,1,0,110,climax. His family were enormously wealthy--even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach--,1,0,49, now he'd left Chicago and come East in a fashion,1,0,17, rather took your,2,0,14,: for instance,1,0,27, he'd brought down a string,1,0,42, polo ponies from Lake Forest. it was hard,1,0,59, realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough,1,0,10, do that.
,1,0,24,Why they came East I don,2,0,33,. They had spent a year in France,1,0,14, no particular,1,0,23,, and then drifted here,2,0,128, unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I,2,0,18, believe it--I had,1,0,17, sight into Daisy,1,0,79, heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully,,1,0,62, the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.
,1,0,60,And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over,1,0,24, East Egg to see two old,1,0,16, whom I scarcely,1,0,3, at,2,0,12, Their house,1,0,20, even more elaborate,1,0,2, I,1,0,20,, a cheerful red-and,1,0,44,white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking,1,0,35, bay. The lawn started at the beach,1,0,11, ran toward,1,0,6, front,1,0,19, for a quarter of a,1,0,24,, jumping over sun-dials,1,0,12, brick walks,1,0,116, burning gardens--finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum,1,0,40, its run. The front was broken by a line,1,0,28, French windows, glowing now,1,0,15, reflected gold,1,0,92, wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with,1,0,14, legs apart on,1,0,14, front porch.
,1,0,45,He had changed since his New Haven years. Now,1,0,40, was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty,1,0,20, a rather hard mouth,1,0,75, a supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance,1,0,18, his face and gave,1,0,15, the appearance,1,0,28, always leaning aggressively,1,0,107,. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body--he seemed,1,0,93, fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack,1,0,46, muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under,1,0,10, thin coat,1,0,22, It was a body capable,1,0,34, enormous leverage--a cruel body.
,1,0,12,His speaking,1,0,94,, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch,1,0,86, paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked--and there were men at New Haven,1,0,21, had hated his guts.
,1,0,9,"Now, don,1,0,17, think my opinion,1,0,35, these matters is final," he seemed,1,0,11, say, "just,1,0,2, I,1,0,21, stronger and more of,1,0,116, man than you are." We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression,1,0,12, he approved,1,0,14, me and wanted,2,0,59, like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.
,1,0,19,We talked for a few,1,0,21, on the sunny porch.
,1,0,75,"I've got a nice place here," he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.
,1,0,10,Turning me,1,0,12, by one arm,,1,0,30, moved a broad flat hand along,1,0,73, front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre,1,0,81, deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motor-boat that bumped the tide offshore.
,1,0,12,"It belonged,1,0,36, Demaine, the oil man." He turned me,1,0,29, again, politely and abruptly,1,0,20, "We'll go inside."
,1,0,142,We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows,1,0,5, ajar,1,0,23, gleaming white against,1,0,32, fresh grass outside that seemed,1,0,43, grow a little way into the house. A breeze,3,0,34, room, blew curtains in at one end,1,0,8, out the,1,0,174, like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.
,1,0,40,The only completely stationary object in,1,0,30, room was an enormous couch on,1,0,110, two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses,1,0,30, rippling and fluttering as if,3,0,104, been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening,1,0,18, the whip and snap,1,0,27, the curtains and the groan,1,0,13, a picture on,2,0,12,. Then there,1,0,45, a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows,1,0,75, the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and,1,0,48, two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.
,1,0,14,The younger of,2,0,15, was a stranger,1,0,47, me. She was extended full length at her end of,1,0,71, divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if,1,0,54, were balancing something on it which was quite likely,1,0,31, fall. If she saw me out of the,3,0,36, eyes she gave no hint of it--indeed,1,0,13, I was almost,1,0,47, into murmuring an apology for having disturbed,1,0,15, by coming in.
,1,0,21,The other girl, Daisy,1,0,16, made an attempt,1,0,26, rise--she leaned slightly,1,0,136, with a conscientious expression--then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.
,1,0,2,"I,1,0,54, p-paralyzed with happiness." She laughed again, as if,1,0,5, said,1,0,35, very witty, and held my hand for a,1,0,90,, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted,1,0,29, see. That was a way she had.,1,0,19, hinted in a murmur,1,0,65, the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I've heard it said,1,0,113, Daisy's murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)
,1,0,6,At any,2,0,72, Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and,1,0,19, quickly tipped her,2,0,92, again--the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something,2,0,21, fright. Again a sort,1,0,65, apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self,1,0,35,sufficiency draws a stunned tribute,1,0,5, me.
,1,0,13,I looked back,2,0,8, cousin,,1,0,48, began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling,2,0,16, It was the kind,3,0,32, the ear follows up and down, as,1,0,49, each speech is an arrangement of notes that will,1,0,16, be played again,1,0,17, Her face was sad,1,0,45, lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes,1,0,2, a,1,0,18, passionate mouth,,3,0,17, an excitement in,2,0,112, that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered "Listen," a promise,2,0,23, had done gay, exciting,1,0,53, just a while since and that there were gay, exciting,1,0,12, hovering in,1,0,12, next hour.
,1,0,125,I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.
,1,0,13,"Do they miss,3,0,19, cried ecstatically,1,0,1,
,1,0,4,"The,1,0,157, town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there's a persistent wail all night along the north shore."
,1,0,18,"How gorgeous! Let,1,0,13, go back, Tom,1,0,4, To-,1,0,30,!" Then she added irrelevantly,2,0,9,You ought,1,0,13, see the baby,1,0,1,
,1,0,9,"I'd like,1,0,3,."
,1,0,14,"She's asleep.,1,0,25,'s three years old. Haven,1,0,21, you ever seen her?"
,1,0,8,"Never.",2,0,16,"Well, you ought,1,0,9, see her.,1,0,8,'s----"
,1,0,81,Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested,1,0,5, hand,1,0,3, my,2,0,1,
,1,0,21,"What you doing, Nick,1,0,1,
,1,0,2,"I,1,0,14, a bond man."
,1,0,12,"Who with?"
,1,0,6,I told,1,0,2,.
,1,0,45,"Never heard of them," he remarked decisively,1,0,1,
,1,0,17,This annoyed me.
,1,0,31,"You will," I answered shortly.,1,0,11,You will if,1,0,20, stay in the East."
,1,0,31,"Oh, I'll stay in the East, don,1,0,39, you worry," he said, glancing at Daisy,1,0,10, then back,1,0,7, me, as,2,0,52, were alert for something more. "I'd be a God damned,1,0,25, to live anywhere else."
,1,0,7,At this,1,0,17, Miss Baker said:,1,0,33,Absolutely!" with such suddenness,1,0,67, I started--it was the first word she uttered since I came into the,1,0,36,. Evidently it surprised her as much,1,0,44, it did me, for she yawned and with a series,1,0,12, rapid, deft,1,0,14, stood up into,1,0,7, room.
,1,0,2,"I,1,0,6, stiff,2,0,49, complained, "I've been lying on that sofa for as,2,0,6, I can,1,0,2,.",2,0,4,"Don,1,0,8, look at,1,0,36,," Daisy retorted, "I've been trying,1,0,36, get you to New York all afternoon.",2,0,11,"No, thanks,1,0,66, said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, "I,1,0,26, absolutely in training."
,1,0,18,Her host looked at,1,0,14, incredulously,1,0,1,
,1,0,23,"You are!" He took down,1,0,9, drink as,3,0,10, a drop in,1,0,61, bottom of a glass. "How you ever get anything done is beyond,1,0,2,.",2,0,33,I looked at Miss Baker, wondering,1,0,21, it was she "got done,1,0,21, I enjoyed looking at,1,0,35,. She was a slender, small-breasted,1,0,31,, with an erect carriage, which,1,0,12, accentuated,1,0,9, throwing,1,0,90, body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her gray sun-strained eyes looked back,1,0,3, me,1,0,32, polite reciprocal curiosity out,1,0,48, a wan, charming, discontented face. It occurred,1,0,7, me now,1,0,11, I had seen,1,0,14,, or a picture,2,0,20,, somewhere before.
,1,0,51,"You live in West Egg," she remarked contemptuously,2,0,24,I know somebody there."
,1,0,6,"I don,1,0,7, know a,1,0,6,----"
,1,0,9,"You must,1,0,7, Gatsby,1,0,1,
,1,0,24,"Gatsby?" demanded Daisy,2,0,11,What Gatsby,1,0,1,
,1,0,136,Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled,1,0,24, from the room as though,1,0,42, were moving a checker to another square.
,1,0,48,Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on,2,0,76,, the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch, open toward,1,0,40, sunset, where four candles flickered on,1,0,6, table,1,0,22, the diminished wind.
,1,0,12,"Why CANDLES,1,0,52, objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with,2,0,9,. "In two,1,0,6, it'll,1,0,61, the longest day in the year." She looked at us all radiantly,2,0,2,Do,1,0,45, always watch for the longest day of the year,1,0,10, then miss,1,0,48,? I always watch for the longest day in the year,1,0,10, then miss,1,0,2,.",2,0,9,"We ought,1,0,49, plan something," yawned Miss Baker, sitting down,1,0,44, the table as if she were getting into bed.
,1,0,4,"All,2,0,11, said Daisy,2,0,46,What'll we plan?" She turned to me helplessly:,1,0,22,What do people plan?"
,1,0,14,Before I could,1,0,45, her eyes fastened with an awed expression on,1,0,14, little finger,1,0,1,
,1,0,7,"Look!",1,0,12, complained;,1,0,9,I hurt it,1,0,1,
,1,0,30,We all looked--the knuckle was,2,0,7, blue.
,1,0,16,"You did it, Tom,2,0,16, said accusingly,2,0,15,I know you didn,1,0,9, mean to,,1,0,11, you DID do,1,0,81,. That's what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical,1,0,11, of a----"
,1,0,25,"I hate that word hulking,1,0,42, objected Tom crossly, "even in kidding."
,1,0,8,"Hulking,1,0,15, insisted Daisy,1,0,1,
,1,0,140,Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool,1,0,20, their white dresses,1,0,37, their impersonal eyes in the absence,1,0,32, all desire. They were here, and,1,0,58, accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort,1,0,19, entertain or to be,1,0,33,. They knew that presently dinner,1,0,57, be over and a little later the evening too would be over,1,0,44, casually put away. It was sharply different,1,0,10, the West,,1,0,37, an evening was hurried from phase to,1,0,113, toward its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself,1,0,1,
,1,0,36,"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,1,0,15, I confessed on,1,0,13, second glass,1,0,52, corky but rather impressive claret. "Can't you talk,1,0,19, crops or something,1,0,1,
,1,0,45,I meant nothing in particular by this remark,,1,0,39, it was taken up in an unexpected way.
,1,0,21,"Civilization's going,1,0,7, pieces,1,0,24, broke out Tom violently,2,0,38,I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist,1,0,13, things. Have,1,0,7, read ',1,0,52, Rise of the Colored Empires' by this man Goddard?"
,1,0,8,"Why, no,1,0,41, I answered, rather surprised by his tone,1,0,1,
,1,0,44,"Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought,3,0,23,. The idea is if we don,1,0,90, look out the white race will be--will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff; it,1,0,14, been proved.",2,0,28,"Tom's getting very profound,1,0,96, said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. "He reads deep books with long words in,1,0,29,. What was that word we----"
,1,0,5,"Well,1,0,75, these books are all scientific," insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently,2,0,51,This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up,1,0,65, us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races,1,0,25, have control of things.",2,0,6,"We've,1,0,8, to beat,1,0,69, down," whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.
,1,0,10,"You ought,1,0,60, live in California--" began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted,1,0,33, by shifting heavily in his chair,1,0,1,
,1,0,65,"This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are,,1,0,80,----" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and,1,0,7, winked,1,0,9, me again,1,0,10, "--And we,1,0,29, produced all the things that,1,0,25, to make civilization--oh,1,0,45, science and art, and all that. Do you see?"
,1,0,5,There,1,0,44, something pathetic in his concentration, as,1,0,28, his complacency, more acute,1,0,23, of old, was not enough,1,0,13, him any more,1,0,13, When, almost,1,0,15,, the telephone,1,0,105, inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.
,1,0,10,"I'll tell,1,0,18, a family secret,",1,0,27, whispered enthusiastically,2,0,32,It's about the butler's nose. Do,1,0,30, want to hear about the butler,1,0,8, nose?"
,1,0,5,"That,1,0,27, why I came over to-night.",2,0,14,"Well, he wasn,1,0,17, always a butler;,1,0,5, used,1,0,23, be the silver polisher,1,0,107, some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning,2,0,24,, until finally it began,1,0,22, affect his nose----"
,1,0,17,"Things went from,4,0,21, suggested Miss Baker,1,0,1,
,1,0,4,"Yes,1,0,17, Things went from,3,0,30,, until finally he had to give,1,0,15, his position.",2,0,260,For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened--then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.
,1,0,15,The butler came,1,0,29, and murmured something close,1,0,46, Tom's ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back,1,0,7, chair,,1,0,91, without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned,1,0,39, again, her voice glowing and singing.
,1,0,37,"I love to see you at my table, Nick.,1,0,7, remind,2,0,31, a--of a rose, an absolute rose,1,0,6, Doesn,1,0,48, he?" She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation:,1,0,19,An absolute rose?"
,1,0,15,This was untrue,1,0,97, I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from,1,0,28,, as if her heart was trying,1,0,95, come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw,1,0,10, napkin on,1,0,6, table,1,0,8, excused,1,0,14, and went into,1,0,8, house.
,1,0,60,Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid,1,0,21, meaning. I was about,1,0,39, speak when she sat up alertly and said,1,0,68,Sh!" in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in,1,0,61, room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying,1,0,39, hear. The murmur trembled on the verge,1,0,68, coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether,1,0,1,
,1,0,8,"This Mr,1,0,17, Gatsby you spoke,1,0,29, is my neighbor----" I said.
,1,0,4,"Don,1,0,36, talk. I want to hear what happens.",2,0,23,"Is something happening,1,0,22, I inquired innocently,1,0,1,
,1,0,16,"You mean to say,3,0,44, know?" said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.,1,0,26,I thought everybody knew.",2,0,6,"I don,1,0,3,."
,1,0,37,"Why----" she said hesitantly, "Tom's,1,0,26, some woman in New York."
,1,0,36,"Got some woman?" I repeated blankly,1,0,1,
,1,0,19,Miss Baker nodded.
,1,0,10,"She might,1,0,16, the decency not,1,0,34, telephone him at dinner time. Don,1,0,13, you think?"
,1,0,27,Almost before I had grasped,1,0,14, meaning there,1,0,12, the flutter,1,0,23, a dress and the crunch,1,0,33, leather boots, and Tom and Daisy,1,0,5, back,1,0,12, the table.
,1,0,10,"It couldn,1,0,42, be helped!" cried Daisy with tense gaiety,1,0,1,
,1,0,7,She sat,1,0,21,, glanced searchingly,1,0,11, Miss Baker,1,0,111, then at me, and continued: "I looked outdoors for a minute, and it's very romantic outdoors. There's a bird on,1,0,5, lawn,1,0,101, I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He's singing away----" Her,1,0,6, sang:,1,0,2,It,1,0,14, romantic, isn,2,0,8,, Tom?"
,1,0,14,"Very romantic,1,0,35, he said, and then miserably to me:,1,0,41,If it's light enough after dinner, I want,1,0,14, take you down,1,0,14, the stables.",2,0,58,The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook,2,0,30, decisively at Tom the subject,1,0,98, the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five,1,0,38, at table I remember the candles being,1,0,51, again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting,1,0,14, look squarely,1,0,47, every one, and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn,1,0,6, guess,1,0,61, Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker,,1,0,10, seemed to,1,0,41, mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was,1,0,8, utterly,1,0,51, put this fifth guest's shrill metallic urgency out,1,0,5, mind,1,0,5, To a,1,0,118, temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing--my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.
,1,0,20,The horses, needless,4,0,79, not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between,1,0,15,, strolled back,2,0,74, library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying,1,0,149, look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat,1,0,5, side,3,0,18, a wicker settee.
,1,0,22,Daisy took her face in,2,0,70, as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into,1,0,12, velvet dusk,1,0,50, I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I,1,0,72, what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.
,1,0,3,"We,2,0,10, know each,1,0,5, very,1,0,8,, Nick,",1,0,14, said suddenly,2,0,7,Even if,1,0,22, are cousins. You didn,1,0,22, come to my wedding."
,1,0,7,"I wasn,1,0,20, back from the war.",2,0,5,"That,1,0,22, true." She hesitated.,1,0,60,Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick, and I'm pretty cynical,1,0,13, everything.",2,0,24,Evidently she had reason,1,0,26, be. I waited but she didn,1,0,8, say any,1,0,45,, and after a moment I returned rather feebly,1,0,12, the subject,1,0,15, her daughter.
,1,0,50,"I suppose she talks, and--eats, and everything."
,1,0,36,"Oh, yes." She looked at me absently,2,0,20,Listen, Nick; let me,2,0,37, what I said when she was born. Would,1,0,5, like,1,0,8, hear?"
,1,0,5,"Very,1,0,3,."
,1,0,59,"It'll show you how I've gotten to feel about--things. Well,1,0,66, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke,1,0,4, out,1,0,71, the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right,2,0,3, it,1,0,6, a boy,1,0,2, a,1,0,16,. She told me it,1,0,24, a girl, and so I turned,1,0,20, head away and wept.,1,0,19,all right,' I said,,1,0,1,I,1,0,125, glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool--that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool."
,1,0,56,"You see I think everything's terrible anyhow," she went,1,0,19, in a convinced way,1,0,81, "Everybody thinks so--the most advanced people. And I KNOW. I've been everywhere,1,0,5, seen,1,0,9, and done,1,0,128,." Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. "Sophisticated--God, I,1,0,17, sophisticated!"
,1,0,31,The instant her voice broke off,1,0,8, ceasing,1,0,10, compel my,1,0,110,, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening,1,0,21, been a trick of some,1,0,60, to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure,1,0,30,, in a moment she looked at me,1,0,32, an absolute smirk on her lovely,1,0,7,, as if,1,0,28, had asserted her membership,1,0,30, a rather distinguished secret,1,0,30, to which she and Tom belonged,1,0,1,
,1,0,32,Inside, the crimson room bloomed,1,0,8, light.
,1,0,36,Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end,2,0,11, long couch,2,0,72, read aloud to him from the SATURDAY EVENING POST.--the words, murmurous,1,0,86, uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light, bright on his boots,1,0,5, dull,1,0,63, the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as,1,0,29, turned a page with a flutter,1,0,19, slender muscles in,1,0,7, arms.
,1,0,24,When we came in she held,1,0,7, silent,1,0,2, a,1,0,21, with a lifted hand.
,1,0,16,"To be continued,1,0,72, she said, tossing the magazine on the table, "in our very next issue."
,1,0,66,Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and,1,0,11, stood up.
,1,0,6,"Ten o,2,0,66,," she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. "Time,1,0,15, this good girl,1,0,13, go to bed."
,1,0,9,"Jordan's,2,0,76, play in the tournament to-morrow," explained Daisy, "over at Westchester."
,1,0,27,"Oh--you're Jordan BAKER."
,1,0,168,I knew now why her face was familiar--its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot,1,0,81, and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story,,1,0,33, what it was I had forgotten long,1,0,2,.
,1,0,11,"Good night,3,0,7, softly,2,0,21,Wake me at eight, won,2,0,3,."
,1,0,3,"If,1,0,13,'ll get up."
,1,0,23,"I will. Good night, Mr,1,0,9, Carraway,1,0,16, See you anon."
,1,0,3,"Of,1,0,9, you will,1,0,16, confirmed Daisy,2,0,2,In,1,0,62, I think I'll arrange a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I,1,0,33, sort of--oh--fling you together.,1,0,15, know--lock you,1,0,54, accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea,1,0,2, a,1,0,19,, and all that sort,1,0,12, thing----"
,1,0,48,"Good night," called Miss Baker from the stairs.,1,0,7,I haven,1,0,16, heard a word."
,1,0,13,"She's a nice,2,0,25, said Tom after a moment.,1,0,11,They oughtn,1,0,45, to let her run around the country this way.",2,0,11,"Who oughtn,1,0,27, to?" inquired Daisy coldly,1,0,1,
,1,0,14,"Her family."
,1,0,46,"Her family is one aunt about a thousand years,1,0,23,. Besides, Nick's going,1,0,21, look after her, aren,1,0,23, you, Nick? She's going,1,0,11, spend lots,1,0,24, week-ends out here this,1,0,46,. I think the home influence will be very good,1,0,6, her.",2,0,20,Daisy and Tom looked,6,0,11, in silence,1,0,1,
,1,0,21,"Is she from New York,1,0,2, I,1,0,8, quickly,1,0,1,
,1,0,36,"From Louisville. Our white girlhood,1,0,49, passed together there. Our beautiful white----"
,1,0,4,"Did,1,0,78, give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?" demanded Tom suddenly,1,0,1,
,1,0,27,"Did I?" She looked at me.
,1,0,13,"I can't seem,1,0,10, remember,,1,0,8, I think,1,0,7, talked,1,0,21, the Nordic race. Yes,1,0,2, I,1,0,21, sure we did. It sort,1,0,9, crept up,2,0,31, and first thing you know----"
,1,0,4,"Don,1,0,19, believe everything,2,0,22,, Nick," he advised me,1,0,1,
,1,0,42,I said lightly that I had heard nothing at,1,0,11,, and a few,2,0,51, I got up to go home. They came to the door with me,1,0,11, stood side,2,0,80, in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called:,1,0,7,Wait!"
,1,0,99,"I forgot to ask you something, and it's important. We heard you were engaged to a girl out West."
,1,0,5,"That,3,0,24, corroborated Tom kindly,2,0,33,We heard that you were engaged."
,1,0,14,"It's libel. I,1,0,11, too poor.",2,0,48,"But we heard it," insisted Daisy, surprising me,1,0,92, opening up again in a flower-like way. "We heard it from three people, so it must be true.",2,0,2,Of,1,0,32, I knew what they were referring,1,0,1,,,1,0,7, I wasn,1,0,31, even vaguely engaged. The fact,1,0,31, gossip had published the banns,1,0,4, one,1,0,80, the reasons I had come East. You can't stop going with an old friend on account,1,0,25, rumors, and on the other,1,0,6, I had,1,0,10, intention,1,0,30, being rumored into marriage.
,1,0,79,Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich--nevertheless,1,0,55, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away.,1,0,10, seemed to,2,0,23, the thing for Daisy to,2,0,86, to rush out of the house, child in arms--but apparently there were no such intentions,1,0,31, her head. As for Tom, the fact,2,0,5, "had,1,0,13, woman in New,2,0,102, was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble,1,0,9, the edge,1,0,49, stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no,1,0,31, nourished his peremptory heart,1,0,1,
,1,0,7,Already,1,0,35, was deep summer on roadhouse roofs,1,0,9, in front,1,0,58, wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools,1,0,215, light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in,1,0,6, trees,1,0,48, a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of,1,0,50, earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette,1,0,28, a moving cat wavered across,1,0,83, moonlight, and turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone--fifty feet,1,0,21, a figure had emerged,2,0,7, shadow,1,0,12, my neighbor,1,0,43, mansion and was standing with his hands in,2,0,106, regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of,1,0,29, feet upon the lawn suggested,2,0,7, was Mr,1,0,21, Gatsby himself, come,1,0,13, to determine,1,0,37, share was his of our local heavens.
,1,0,9,I decided,1,0,103, call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didn,1,0,45, call to him, for he gave a sudden intimation,1,0,41, he was content to be alone--he stretched,3,0,52, toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as,1,0,13, was from him,1,0,19, I could have sworn,1,0,96, was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward--and distinguished nothing except a single green,1,0,51,, minute and far away, that might have been the end,1,0,108, a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.
,1,0,102,About half way between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside,1,0,19, for a quarter of a,1,0,7,, so as,1,0,12, shrink away,1,0,33, a certain desolate area of land.,1,0,139, is a valley of ashes--a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms,1,0,7, houses,1,0,9, chimneys,1,0,26, rising smoke and, finally,1,0,270, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-gray men swarm up with leaden spades,1,0,70, stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations,1,0,11, your sight,1,0,24, But above the gray land,1,0,11, the spasms,1,0,179, bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic--their irises,1,0,15, one yard high.,1,0,47, look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair,1,0,157, enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of,1,0,83,, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved away.,1,0,60, his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun,1,0,39, rain, brood on over the solemn dumping,1,0,2,.
,1,0,37,The valley of ashes is bounded on one,2,0,144, a small foul river, and, when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as,2,0,5, half,2,0,36,. There is always a halt there of at,1,0,37, a minute, and it was because of this,1,0,38, I first met Tom Buchanan's mistress.
,1,0,8,The fact,1,0,24, he had one was insisted,1,0,9, wherever,1,0,47, was known. His acquaintances resented the fact,1,0,36, he turned up in popular restaurants,1,0,17, her and, leaving,1,0,38, at a table, sauntered about, chatting,1,0,44, whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to,1,0,21, her, I had no desire,1,0,5, meet,1,0,2,--,1,0,24, I did. I went up to New,1,0,41, with Tom on the train one afternoon, and,2,0,37, stopped by the ashheaps he jumped to,3,0,13,, taking hold,1,0,9, my elbow,1,0,35, literally forced me from the car.
,1,0,32,"We're getting off," he insisted,2,0,10,I want you,1,0,16, meet my girl."
,1,0,69,I think he'd tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination,1,0,25, have my company bordered,1,0,42, violence. The supercilious assumption was,1,0,41, on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better,2,0,2,.
,1,0,82,I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked back a hundred,1,0,6, along,1,0,28, road under Doctor Eckleburg,1,0,17, persistent stare,1,0,27, The only building in sight,1,0,14, a small block,1,0,21, yellow brick sitting,2,0,5, edge,2,0,19, waste land, a sort,1,0,13, compact Main,1,0,64, ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of,1,0,25, three shops it contained,1,0,32, for rent and another was an all,1,0,28,night restaurant, approached,1,0,28, a trail of ashes; the third,1,0,53, a garage--Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars bought and,1,0,30,.--and I followed Tom inside.
,1,0,12,The interior,1,0,13, unprosperous,1,0,31, bare; the only car visible was,1,0,6, dust-,1,0,6, wreck,1,0,55, a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had occurred,1,0,3, me,1,0,84, this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that sumptuous and romantic apartments,1,0,69, concealed overhead, when the proprietor himself appeared in the door,2,0,36, office, wiping his hands on a piece,1,0,7, waste.,1,0,59, was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and faintly handsome,1,0,63, When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue,1,0,2,.
,1,0,23,"Hello, Wilson, old man,1,0,32, said Tom, slapping him jovially,3,0,17,. "How's business,1,0,1,
,1,0,17,"I can't complain,1,0,31, answered Wilson unconvincingly,2,0,12,When are you,2,0,20, sell me that car?"

8,0,36,Although Fuegians from Patagonia may,1,0,21, visited the Falkland,1,0,15, in prehistoric,1,0,13,, the islands,1,0,42, uninhabited when Europeans first explored,1,0,35,. European claims of discovery date,1,0,10, to the 16,2,0,74,, but no consensus exists on whether early explorers sighted the Falklands,1,0,17, other islands in,1,0,6, South,1,0,59,. The first undisputed landing on the islands is attributed,1,0,29, English captain John Strong,,1,0,4,, en,2,0,103, Peru and Chile's littoral in 1690, explored the Falkland Sound and noted the islands' water and game.
,1,0,63,The Falklands remained uninhabited until the 1764 establishment,1,0,76, Port Louis on East Falkland by French captain Louis Antoine de Bougainville,1,0,96, the 1766 foundation of Port Egmont on Saunders Island by British captain John MacBride. Whether,2,0,16, the settlements,1,0,6, aware,1,0,5, each,2,0,44, existence is debated by historians. In 1766,1,0,19, France surrendered,1,0,33, claim on the Falklands to Spain,,1,0,55, renamed the French colony Puerto Soledad the following,2,0,68, Problems began when Spain detected and captured Port Egmont in 1770,1,0,25, War was narrowly avoided,1,0,35, its restitution to Britain in 1771,1,0,1,
,1,0,81,Both the British and Spanish settlements coexisted in the archipelago until 1774,,1,0,59, Britain's new economic and strategic considerations led it,1,0,12, voluntarily,3,0,101, islands, leaving a plaque claiming the Falklands for King George III. Spain's Viceroyalty of the Río,1,0,174, la Plata became the only governmental presence in the territory. West Falkland was left abandoned, and Puerto Soledad became mostly a prison camp. Amid the British invasions,1,0,8, the Río,1,0,16, la Plata during,1,0,150, Napoleonic Wars in Europe, the islands' governor evacuated the archipelago in 1806; Spain's remaining colonial garrison followed suit in 1811, except,1,0,8, gauchos,1,0,37, fishermen who remained voluntarily.
,1,0,10,Thereafter,1,0,72, the archipelago was visited only by fishing ships; its political status,1,0,23, undisputed until 1820,,1,0,56, Colonel David Jewett, an American privateer working for,1,0,17, United Provinces,1,0,58, the Río de la Plata, informed anchored ships about Buenos,1,0,12,' 1816 claim,1,0,6, Spain,1,0,25, territories in the South,1,0,23,. Since the islands had,1,0,22, permanent inhabitants,1,0,15, in 1823 Buenos,1,0,52, granted German-born merchant Luis Vernet permission,1,0,99, conduct fishing activities and exploit feral cattle in the archipelago.Vernet settled at the ruins,1,0,83, Puerto Soledad in 1826, and accumulated resources on the islands until the venture,1,0,14, secure enough,1,0,50, bring settlers and form a permanent colony.Buenos,1,0,45, named Vernet military and civil commander of,1,0,8, islands,1,0,23, 1829, and he attempted,1,0,40, regulate sealing to stop the activities,1,0,16, foreign whalers,1,0,85, sealers. Vernet's venture lasted until a dispute over fishing and hunting rights led,1,0,31, a raid by the American warship,1,0,31, Lexington in 1831, when United,2,0,48, commander Silas Duncan declared the dissolution,2,0,7, island,1,0,13, government.
,1,0,6,Buenos,1,0,10, attempted,1,0,88, retain influence over the settlement by installing a garrison, but a mutiny in 1832 was,1,0,14, the next year,2,0,8, arrival,1,0,38, British forces who reasserted Britain,1,0,42, rule. The Argentine Confederation (headed,1,0,7, Buenos,1,0,57, Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas) protested against Britain,1,0,60, actions,and Argentine governments have continued since then,1,0,27, register official protests,1,0,9, Britain.,1,0,41, British troops departed after completing,1,0,130, mission, leaving the area without formal government. Vernet's deputy, the Scotsman Matthew Brisbane, returned to the islands that,1,0,29, to restore the business, but,1,0,82, efforts ended after, amid unrest at Port Louis, gaucho Antonio Rivero led a group,1,0,151, dissatisfied individuals to murder Brisbane and the settlement's senior leaders; survivors hid in a cave on a nearby island until the British returned,1,0,61, restored order. In 1840, the Falklands became a Crown colony,1,0,86, Scottish settlers subsequently established an official pastoral community. Four years,2,0,26, nearly everyone relocated,1,0,34, Port Jackson, considered a better,2,0,91, government, and merchant Samuel Lafone began a venture to encourage British colonisation.
,1,0,60,Stanley, as Port Jackson was soon renamed, officially became,1,0,5, seat,1,0,19, government in 1845,1,0,21, Early in its history,1,0,8, Stanley,1,0,26, a negative reputation due,1,0,69, cargo-shipping losses; only in emergencies would ships rounding Cape,1,0,31, stop at the port. Nevertheless,1,0,48, the Falklands' geographic location proved ideal,1,0,110, ship repairs and the "Wrecking Trade", the business of selling and buying shipwrecks and their cargoes. Aside,1,0,67, this trade, commercial interest in the archipelago was minimal due,1,0,89, the low-value hides of the feral cattle roaming the pastures. Economic growth began only,1,0,13, the Falkland,1,0,9, Company,,1,0,125, bought out Lafone's failing enterprise in 1851, successfully introduced Cheviot sheep for wool farming, spurring other farms,1,0,7, follow,2,0,14, The high cost,1,0,30, importing materials, combined,1,0,13, the shortage,1,0,7, labour,1,0,160, consequent high wages, meant the ship repair trade became uncompetitive. After 1870, it declined as the replacement of sail ships by steamships was accelerated,1,0,13, the low cost,1,0,49, coal in South America; by 1914, with the opening,2,0,7, Panama,1,0,38,, the trade effectively ended. In 1881,1,0,13, the Falkland,1,0,52, became financially independent of Britain. For more,1,0,24, a century, the Falkland,1,0,18, Company dominated,1,0,6, trade,1,0,43, employment of the archipelago; in addition,2,0,55, owned most housing in Stanley, which greatly benefited,2,0,25, wool trade with the UK.
,1,0,17,In the first half,1,0,7, the 20,2,0,25,, the Falklands served an,3,0,8, Britain,1,0,43, territorial claims to subantarctic islands,1,0,10, a section,1,0,69, Antarctica. The Falklands governed these territories as the Falkland,1,0,49, Dependencies starting in 1908, and retained them,1,0,18, their dissolution,1,0,5, 1985,1,0,34, The Falklands also played a minor,3,0,49, two world wars as a military base aiding control,1,0,33, the South Atlantic. In the First,2,0,7, Battle,1,0,13, the Falkland,1,0,26, in December 1914, a Royal,1,0,64, fleet defeated an Imperial German squadron. In the Second World,1,0,11,, following,1,0,21, December 1939 Battle,1,0,109, the River Plate, the battle-damaged HMS Exeter steamed to the Falklands for repairs. In 1942, a battalion en,1,0,88, to India was redeployed to the Falklands as a garrison amid fears of a Japanese seizure,1,0,73, the archipelago. After the war ended, the Falklands economy was affected,1,0,15, declining wool,2,0,36, the political uncertainty resulting,1,0,59, the revived sovereignty dispute between the United Kingdom,1,0,12, Argentina.
,1,0,33,Simmering tensions between the UK,1,0,27, Argentina increased during,1,0,7, second,2,0,70, the century, when Argentine President Juan Perón asserted sovereignty,2,0,56, archipelago. The sovereignty dispute intensified during,1,0,5, 1960,1,0,9,, shortly,1,0,28, the United Nations passed a,1,0,46, on decolonisation which Argentina interpreted,1,0,11, favourable,2,0,18, position. In 1965,1,0,15, the UN General,1,0,32, passed Resolution 2065, calling,1,0,12, both states,1,0,18, conduct bilateral,1,0,34, to reach a peaceful settlement of,1,0,30, dispute. From 1966 until 1968,1,0,60, the UK confidentially discussed with Argentina the transfer,1,0,56, the Falklands, assuming its judgement would be accepted,1,0,103, the islanders. An agreement on trade ties between the archipelago and the mainland was reached in 1971,1,0,14,, consequently,1,0,37, Argentina built a temporary airfield,1,0,29, Stanley in 1972. Nonetheless,1,0,33, Falklander dissent, as expressed,1,0,54, their strong lobby in the UK Parliament, and tensions,1,0,4, the,2,0,66, Argentina effectively limited sovereignty negotiations until 1977,1,0,1,
,1,0,24,Concerned at the expense,1,0,25, maintaining the Falkland,1,0,10, in an era,1,0,7, budget,1,0,193,, the UK again considered transferring sovereignty to Argentina in the early Thatcher government. Substantive sovereignty talks again ended by 1981, and the dispute escalated with passing time.,1,0,11, April 1982,1,0,14, the Falklands,1,0,59, began when Argentine military forces invaded the Falklands,1,0,26, other British territories,1,0,68, the South Atlantic, briefly occupying them until a UK expeditionary,1,0,26, retook the territories in,1,0,44,. After the war, the United Kingdom expanded,1,0,9, military,1,0,53,, building RAF Mount Pleasant and increasing the size,1,0,74, its garrison. The war also left some 117 minefields containing nearly 20,,1,0,24, mines of various types,,1,0,5, anti,1,0,11,vehicle and,2,0,20,personnel mines. Due,1,0,17, the large number,1,0,104, deminer casualties, initial attempts to clear the mines ceased in 1983. Demining operations recommenced,1,0,24, 2009 and were completed,1,0,13, October 2020,1,0,1,
,1,0,5,Based,1,0,16, Lord Shackleton,1,0,101, recommendations, the Falklands diversified from a sheep-based monoculture into an economy of tourism,1,0,24,, with the establishment,2,0,20, Falklands Exclusive,2,0,80,, fisheries. The road network was also made more extensive, and the construction,1,0,34, RAF Mount Pleasant allowed access,1,0,58, long haul flights. Oil exploration also began in the 2010,1,0,64,, with indications of possible commercially exploitable deposits,2,0,74, Falklands basin. Landmine clearance work restarted in 2009, in accordance,1,0,21, the UK's obligations,1,0,42, the Ottawa Treaty, and Sapper Hill Corral,1,0,42, cleared of mines in 2012, allowing access,1,0,47, an important historical landmark for the first,2,0,3, 30,2,0,36, Argentina and the UK re-established,2,0,45, in 1990, but neither has agreed on the terms,1,0,91, future sovereignty discussions. Disputes between the governments have led "some analysts [,1,0,31,] predict a growing conflict of,1,0,18, between Argentina,1,0,6, Great,1,0,36, ... because of the recent expansion,1,0,12, the fishing,1,0,42, in the waters surrounding the Falklands".,

8,0,26,I stand here today humbled,1,0,16, the task before,1,0,10,, grateful,1,0,37, the trust you have bestowed, mindful,1,0,21, the sacrifices borne,1,0,38, our ancestors. I thank President Bush,1,0,15, his service to,1,0,11, nation, as,2,0,38, the generosity and cooperation he has,1,0,29, throughout this transition.
,1,0,52,Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential,1,0,11,. The words,1,0,46, been spoken during rising tides of prosperity,1,0,17, the still waters,1,0,21, peace. Yet, every so,1,0,9, the oath,1,0,122, taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill,1,0,51, vision of those in high office, but because We the,1,0,23, have remained faithful,1,0,11, the ideals,1,0,51, our forbearers, and true to our founding documents,1,0,1,
,1,0,5,So it,1,0,44, been. So it must be with this generation of,1,0,2,.
,1,0,18,That we are in the,2,0,48, crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at,1,0,32,, against a far-reaching network,1,0,66, violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence,1,0,6, greed,1,0,24, irresponsibility on the,2,0,38, some, but also our collective failure,1,0,10, make hard,1,0,23, and prepare the nation,1,0,43, a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed,1,0,33, businesses shuttered. Our health,1,0,15, is too costly;,1,0,17, schools fail too,1,0,38,; and each day brings further evidence,1,0,34, the ways we use energy strengthen,1,0,12, adversaries,1,0,9, threaten,1,0,9, planet.
,1,0,43,These are the indicators of crisis, subject,1,0,44, data and statistics. Less measurable but no,1,0,22, profound is a sapping,1,0,44, confidence across our land - a nagging fear,1,0,51, America's decline is inevitable, and that the next,1,0,11, must lower,1,0,9, sights.
,1,0,18,Today I say to you,1,0,18, the challenges we,1,0,46, are real. They are serious and they are many.,1,0,23, will not be met easily,1,0,16, in a short span,3,0,25, But know this, America -,1,0,14, will be met.
,1,0,30,On this day, we gather because,1,0,37, have chosen hope over fear, unity of,1,0,26, over conflict and discord,1,0,1,
,1,0,39,On this day, we come to proclaim an end,1,0,94, the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far,2,0,30, have strangled our politics.
,1,0,17,We remain a young,1,0,1,,,1,0,13, in the words,1,0,20, Scripture, the time,2,0,39, to set aside childish things. The time,2,0,12, to reaffirm,1,0,47, enduring spirit; to choose our better history;,1,0,66, carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from,3,0,10,: the God-,1,0,21, promise that all are,1,0,19,, all are free, and,1,0,17, deserve a chance,1,0,7, pursue,1,0,13, full measure,1,0,12, happiness.
,1,0,28,In reaffirming the greatness,1,0,4, our,1,0,1,,,1,0,11, understand,1,0,69, greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never,1,0,4, one,1,0,7, short-,1,0,12, or settling,1,0,31, less. It has not been the path,1,0,11, the faint-,1,0,12, - for those,1,0,53, prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures,1,0,11, riches and,1,0,60,. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers,1,0,48, things - some celebrated but more often men and,1,0,11, obscure in,1,0,71, labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity,1,0,10, freedom.
,1,0,19,For us, they packed,2,0,12, few worldly,2,0,26, traveled across oceans in,2,0,13, a new life.
,1,0,33,For us, they toiled in sweatshops,1,0,47, settled the West; endured the lash of the whip,1,0,24, plowed the hard earth.
,1,0,23,For us, they fought and,1,0,24,, in places like Concord,1,0,21, Gettysburg; Normandy,1,0,11, Khe Sahn.
,1,0,28,Time and again these men and,1,0,41, struggled and sacrificed and worked till,1,0,6, hands,1,0,35, raw so that we might live a better,1,0,18,. They saw America,1,0,7, bigger,1,0,8, the sum,1,0,91, our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
,1,0,38,This is the journey we continue today.,1,0,44, remain the most prosperous, powerful nation,1,0,6, Earth,1,0,35, Our workers are no less productive,1,0,71, when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and,1,0,15, no less needed,1,0,37, they were last week or last month or,1,0,151, year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time,1,0,54, surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves,1,0,6,, dust,2,0,1,,,1,0,6, begin,1,0,31, the work of remaking America.
,1,0,17,For everywhere we,1,0,1,,,1,0,11, is work to,2,0,32,. The state of the economy calls,1,0,17, action, bold and,1,0,19,, and we will act -,2,0,14, to create new,1,0,1,,,1,0,13, to lay a new,2,0,32, growth. We will build the roads,2,0,20,, the electric grids,1,0,37, digital lines that feed our commerce,1,0,8, bind us,1,0,1,.,1,0,28, will restore science to its,2,0,63,, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality,1,0,84, lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars,1,0,4, run,1,0,33, factories. And we will transform,1,0,58, schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands,1,0,15, a new age. All,1,0,19, we can do. And all,1,0,13, we will do.
,1,0,4,Now,,2,0,28, some who question the scale,1,0,160, our ambitions - who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten what this country has already,1,0,19,; what free men and,1,0,29, can achieve when imagination,1,0,40, joined to common purpose, and necessity,1,0,10, courage.
,1,0,20,What the cynics fail,1,0,11, understand,2,0,31, the ground has shifted beneath,1,0,66, - that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so,1,0,3, no,1,0,23, apply. The question we,1,0,6, today,1,0,4, not,1,0,26, our government is too big,3,0,1,,,1,0,27, whether it works - whether,1,0,37, helps families find jobs at a decent,1,0,15,, care they can,1,0,50,, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer,1,0,15, yes, we intend,1,0,5, move,1,0,24,. Where the answer is no,1,0,32, programs will end. And those of,2,0,44, manage the public's dollars will be held to,1,0,30, - to spend wisely, reform bad,1,0,1,,,1,0,29, do our business in the light,1,0,28, day - because only then can,1,0,41, restore the vital trust between a people,2,0,39, government.
Nor is the question before,1,0,30, whether the market is a force,1,0,79, good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but,1,0,20, crisis has reminded,2,0,19, without a watchful,1,0,25,, the market can spin out,2,0,88, - and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. The success,1,0,41, our economy has always depended not just,1,0,9, the size,1,0,10, our Gross,2,0,1,,,1,0,13, on the reach,1,0,19, our prosperity; on,1,0,63, ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart - not out,1,0,9, charity,,1,0,52, because it is the surest route to our common good.
,1,0,26,As for our common defense,,1,0,46, reject as false the choice between our safety,2,0,21, ideals. Our Founding,1,0,7,, faced,1,0,23, perils we can scarcely,1,0,38,, drafted a charter to assure the rule,3,0,11, the rights,1,0,24, man, a charter expanded,2,0,104, blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's,3,0,94, so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to,1,0,34, small village where my father was,1,0,31,: know that America is a friend,1,0,12, each nation,1,0,11, every man,,1,0,1,,,3,0,24, seeks a future of peace,1,0,26, dignity, and we are ready,1,0,17, lead once more.
,1,0,6,Recall,1,0,43, earlier generations faced down fascism and,1,0,34, not just with missiles and tanks,,1,0,68, with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood,1,0,31, our power alone cannot protect,1,0,10,, nor does,1,0,8, entitle,2,0,9, do as we,1,0,88,. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates,1,0,13, the justness,1,0,21, our cause, the force,2,0,33, example, the tempering qualities,1,0,25, humility and restraint.
,1,0,18,We are the keepers,1,0,20, this legacy. Guided,1,0,6, these,1,0,58, once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even,1,0,226, effort - even greater cooperation and understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan.
