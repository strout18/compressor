8,0,41,Moths that fly by day are not properly to,1,0,14, called moths;,1,0,3, do,1,0,27, excite that pleasant sense,1,0,19, dark autumn nights,1,0,70, ivy-blossom which the commonest yellow-underwing asleep in the shadow,1,0,24, the curtain never fails,1,0,69, rouse in us. They are hybrid creatures, neither gay like butterflies,1,0,7, sombre,1,0,18, their own species,1,0,79, Nevertheless the present specimen, with his narrow hay-coloured wings, fringed,1,0,9, a tassel,1,0,24, the same colour, seemed,1,0,11, be content,1,0,100, life. It was a pleasant morning, mid-September, mild, benignant, yet with a keener breath than that,1,0,18, the summer months,1,0,174, The plough was already scoring the field opposite the window, and where the share had been, the earth was pressed flat and gleamed with moisture. Such vigour came rolling in,1,0,11, the fields,1,0,38, the down beyond that it was difficult,1,0,59, keep the eyes strictly turned upon the book. The rooks too,1,0,15, keeping one of,1,0,96, annual festivities; soaring round the tree tops until it looked as if a vast net with thousands,1,0,40, black knots in it had been cast up into,1,0,88, air; which, after a few moments sank slowly down upon the trees until every twig seemed,1,0,23, have a knot at the end,1,0,19, it. Then, suddenly,1,0,54, the net would be thrown into the air again in a wider,1,0,5, this,1,0,66,, with the utmost clamour and vociferation, as though to be thrown,2,0,88, air and settle slowly down upon the tree tops were a tremendously exciting experience.
,1,0,68,The same energy which inspired the rooks, the ploughmen, the horses,,1,0,16, even, it seemed,1,0,63, the lean bare-backed downs, sent the moth fluttering from side,2,0,3, of,1,0,76, square of the window-pane. One could not help watching him. One was, indeed,1,0,37, conscious of a queer feeling of pity,1,0,82, him. The possibilities of pleasure seemed that morning so enormous and so various,1,0,27, to have only a moth's part,1,0,160, life, and a day moth's at that, appeared a hard fate, and his zest in enjoying his meagre opportunities to the full, pathetic. He flew vigorously to one corner,1,0,22, his compartment, and,,1,0,158, waiting there a second, flew across to the other. What remained for him but to fly to a third corner and then to a fourth? That was all he could do, in spite,1,0,9, the size,1,0,21, the downs, the width,2,0,66, sky, the far-off smoke of houses, and the romantic voice, now and,1,0,21,, of a steamer out at,2,0,14, What he could,1,0,3, he,1,0,10,. Watching,1,0,98,, it seemed as if a fibre, very thin but pure, of the enormous energy of the world had been thrust,1,0,114, his frail and diminutive body. As often as he crossed the pane, I could fancy that a thread of vital light became,1,0,18,. He was little or,1,0,11, but life.
,1,0,33,Yet, because he was so small, and,1,0,14, simple a form,1,0,81, the energy that was rolling in at the open window and driving its way through so,1,0,60, narrow and intricate corridors in my own brain and in those,1,0,12, other human,1,0,52,, there was something marvellous as well as pathetic,1,0,4, him,1,0,10, It was as,1,0,8, someone,1,0,57, taken a tiny bead of pure life and decking it as lightly,2,0,86, with down and feathers, had set it dancing and zig-zagging to show us the true nature,1,0,60, life. Thus displayed one could not get over the strangeness,1,0,15, it. One is apt,1,0,11, forget all,1,0,117, life, seeing it humped and bossed and garnished and cumbered so that it has to move with the greatest circumspection,1,0,150, dignity. Again, the thought of all that life might have been had he been born in any other shape caused one to view his simple activities with a kind,1,0,7, pity.
,1,0,22,After a time, tired by,1,0,100, dancing apparently, he settled on the window ledge in the sun, and, the queer spectacle being at an,1,0,10,, I forgot,1,0,34, him. Then, looking up, my eye was,2,0,5, him.,1,0,11, was trying,1,0,7, resume,1,0,9, dancing,,1,0,23, seemed either so stiff,2,0,8, awkward,1,0,36, he could only flutter to the bottom,1,0,35, the window-pane; and when he tried,1,0,38, fly across it he failed. Being intent,1,0,97, other matters I watched these futile attempts for a time without thinking, unconsciously waiting,1,0,4, him,1,0,7, resume,1,0,21, flight, as one waits,1,0,102, a machine, that has stopped momentarily, to start again without considering the reason of its failure,1,0,65, After perhaps a seventh attempt he slipped from the wooden ledge,1,0,46, fell, fluttering his wings, on to his back on,1,0,7, window,1,0,21,. The helplessness of,1,0,80, attitude roused me. It flashed upon me that he was in difficulties; he could no,1,0,181, raise himself; his legs struggled vainly. But, as I stretched out a pencil, meaning to help him to right himself, it came over me that the failure and awkwardness were the approach,1,0,25, death. I laid the pencil,1,0,8, again.
,1,0,33,The legs agitated themselves once,1,0,38,. I looked as if for the enemy against,1,0,42, he struggled. I looked out of doors. What,2,0,21, there? Presumably it,1,0,132, midday, and work in the fields had stopped. Stillness and quiet had replaced the previous animation. The birds had taken themselves,1,0,11, to feed in,1,0,124, brooks. The horses stood still. Yet the power was there all the same, massed outside indifferent, impersonal, not attending,1,0,12, anything in,1,0,147,. Somehow it was opposed to the little hay-coloured moth. It was useless to try to do anything. One could only watch the extraordinary efforts made,1,0,58, those tiny legs against an oncoming doom which could, had,1,0,58, chosen, have submerged an entire city, not merely a city,,1,0,7, masses,1,0,6, human,1,0,17,; nothing, I knew,1,0,171, had any chance against death. Nevertheless after a pause of exhaustion the legs fluttered again. It was superb this last protest, and so frantic that he succeeded at last,1,0,39, righting himself. One's sympathies, of,2,0,16, were all on the,2,0,11, life. Also,1,0,11, when there,1,0,55, nobody to care or to know, this gigantic effort on the,2,0,87, an insignificant little moth, against a power of such magnitude, to retain what no one,1,0,140, valued or desired to keep, moved one strangely. Again, somehow, one saw life, a pure bead. I lifted the pencil again, useless though I knew,1,0,3, to,2,0,21, But even as I did so,1,0,24, the unmistakable tokens,1,0,225, death showed themselves. The body relaxed, and instantly grew stiff. The struggle was over. The insignificant little creature now knew death. As I looked at the dead moth, this minute wayside triumph of so great a force over,1,0,29, mean an antagonist filled me,1,0,179, wonder. Just as life had been strange a few minutes before, so death was now as strange. The moth having righted himself now lay most decently and uncomplainingly composed. O yes,1,0,36, he seemed to say, death is stronger,1,0,7, I am.
,1,0,43,Evening is kind to Sussex, for Sussex is no,1,0,27, young, and she is grateful,1,0,34, the veil of evening as an elderly,1,0,64, is glad when a shade is drawn over a lamp, and only the outline,1,0,138, her face remains. The outline of Sussex is still very fine. The cliffs stand out to sea, one behind another. All Eastbourne, all Bexhill,,1,0,28, St. Leonards, their parades,1,0,22, their lodging houses,,1,0,15, bead shops and,1,0,6, sweet,1,0,4, and,1,0,9, placards,1,0,15, their invalids,1,0,8, chars-á,1,0,40,bancs, are all obliterated. What remains,1,0,15, what there was,1,0,23, William came over from,1,0,14, ten centuries,1,0,43,: a line of cliffs running out to sea. Also,1,0,75, fields are redeemed. The freckle of red villas on the coast is washed over,1,0,35, a thin lucid lake of brown air, in,1,0,39, they and their redness are drowned. It,1,0,41, still too early for lamps; and too early,1,0,8, stars.
,1,0,15,But, I thought,,1,0,70, is always some sediment of irritation when the moment is as beautiful,2,0,7, is now,1,0,94, The psychologists must explain; one looks up, one is overcome by beauty extravagantly greater,1,0,23, one could expect—there,1,0,16, now pink clouds,1,0,19, Battle; the fields,1,0,89, mottled, marbled—one's perceptions blow out rapidly like air balls expanded by some rush,1,0,76, air, and then, when all seems blown to its fullest and tautest, with beauty,1,0,11, beauty and,1,0,60,, a pin pricks; it collapses. But what is the pin? So far as,1,0,6, could,1,0,26,, the pin had something to,2,0,76, one's own impotency. I cannot hold this—I cannot express this—I am overcome,1,0,83, it—I am mastered. Somewhere in that region one's discontent lay; and it was allied,1,0,9, the idea,1,0,29, one's nature demands mastery,1,0,117, all that it receives; and mastery here meant the power to convey what one saw now over Sussex so that another person,1,0,10, share it.,1,0,8, further,1,0,56, there was another prick of the pin: one was wasting one,1,0,41, chance; for beauty spread at one's right,1,0,4,, at,2,0,6, left;,1,0,4, one,1,0,9, back too,1,0,105, it was escaping all the time; one could only offer a thimble to a torrent that could fill baths, lakes.
,1,0,34,But relinquish, I said (it is well,1,0,174, how in circumstances like these the self splits up and one self is eager and dissatisfied and the other stern and philosophical), relinquish these impossible aspirations; be,2,0,18, the view in front,1,0,16, us, and believe,1,0,5, when,1,0,5, tell,2,0,43, it is best to sit and soak; to be passive;,1,0,45, accept; and do not bother because nature has,1,0,40, you six little pocket knives with which,1,0,29, cut up the body of a whale.
,1,0,90,While these two selves then held a colloquy about the wise course to adopt in the presence,1,0,77, beauty, I (a third party now declared itself) said to myself, how happy they,1,0,106, to enjoy so simple an occupation. There they sat as the car sped along, noticing everything: a hay stack;,1,0,51, rust red roof; a pond; an old man coming home with,1,0,8, sack on,1,0,55, back; there they sat, matching every colour in the sky,1,0,70, earth from their colour box, rigging up little models of Sussex barns,1,0,132, farmhouses in the red light that would serve in the January gloom. But I, being somewhat different, sat aloof and melancholy. While,1,0,27, are thus busied, I said to,2,0,6, Gone,,1,0,7,; over,,2,0,25, past and done with, past,4,0,131, I feel life left behind even as the road is left behind. We have been over that stretch, and are already forgotten. There, windows,1,0,77, lit by our lamps for a second; the light is out now. Others come behind us.
,1,0,122,Then suddenly a fourth self (a self which lies in ambush, apparently dormant, and jumps upon one unawares. Its remarks are,1,0,32, entirely disconnected with what,1,0,5, been,1,0,1,,,1,0,17, must be attended,1,0,40, because of their very abruptness) said:,1,0,4,Look,1,0,84, that." It was a light; brilliant, freakish; inexplicable. For a second I was unable,1,0,134, name it. "A star"; and for that second it held its odd flicker of unexpectedness and danced and beamed. "I take your meaning," I said,2,0,104,You, erratic and impulsive self that you are, feel that the light over the downs there emerging, dangles,1,0,26, the future. Let us try to,1,0,10, this. Let,1,0,10, reason it,1,0,42,. I feel suddenly attached not to the past,2,0,4, the,1,0,35,. I think of Sussex in five hundred,1,0,8, to come,1,0,103, I think much grossness will have evaporated. Things will have been scorched up, eliminated. There will,1,0,32, magic gates. Draughts fan-blown,1,0,116, electric power will cleanse houses. Lights intense and firmly directed will go over the earth, doing the work. Look,1,0,20, the moving light in,1,0,50, hill; it is the headlight of a car. By day and by,1,0,38, Sussex in five centuries will be full,1,0,45, charming thoughts, quick, effective beams."
,1,0,27,The sun was now low beneath,1,0,18, horizon. Darkness,1,0,143, rapidly. None of my selves could see anything beyond the tapering light of our headlamps on the hedge. I summoned them together. "Now," I said,2,0,47,comes the season of making up our accounts. Now,1,0,9, have got,1,0,19, collect ourselves;,1,0,9, have got,1,0,12, be one self,1,0,14, Nothing is to,1,0,166, seen any more, except one wedge of road and bank which our lights repeat incessantly. We are perfectly provided for. We are warmly wrapped in a rug; we are protected,1,0,5, wind,2,0,26,. We are alone. Now is the,1,0,33, of reckoning. Now I, who preside,1,0,22, the company, am going,1,0,90, arrange in order the trophies which we have all brought in. Let me see; there was a great,2,0,22, beauty brought in to-,1,0,40,: farmhouses; cliffs standing out to sea,1,0,31, marbled fields; mottled fields,1,0,20, red feathered skies,1,0,53, all that. Also there was disappearance and the death,1,0,39, the individual. The vanishing road and,1,0,28, window lit for a second and,1,0,21, dark. And then there,1,0,43, the sudden dancing light, that was hung in,1,0,35, future. What we have made then to-,1,0,151,," I said, "is this: that beauty; death of the individual; and the future. Look, I will make a little figure for your satisfaction; here he comes. Does,1,0,24, little figure advancing,1,0,51, beauty, through death, to the economical, powerful,2,0,46, future when houses will be cleansed by a puff,1,0,72, hot wind satisfy you? Look at him; there on my knee." We sat and looked,1,0,51, the figure we had made that day. Great sheer slabs,1,0,35, rock, tree tufted, surrounded him.,1,0,23, was for a second very,,1,0,25, solemn. Indeed it seemed,1,0,79, if the reality of things were displayed there on the rug. A violent thrill ran,1,0,7, us; as,1,0,24, a charge of electricity,1,0,27, entered in to us. We cried,1,0,15, together: "Yes,1,0,9, yes," as,1,0,33, affirming something, in a moment,1,0,14, recognition.
,1,0,79,And then the body who had been silent up to now began its song, almost at first,1,0,4, low,1,0,24, the rush of the wheels:,1,0,21,Eggs and bacon; toast,1,0,27, tea; fire and a bath; fire,4,0,22, jugged hare," it went,1,0,1,,,1,0,30,and red currant jelly; a glass,2,0,80, with coffee to follow, with coffee to follow—and then to bed and then to bed."
,1,0,13,"Off with you,1,0,30, I said to my assembled selves,2,0,12,Your work is,1,0,27,. I dismiss you. Good-night,3,0,12,And the rest,1,0,51, the journey was performed in the delicious society,1,0,14, my own body.
,1,0,88,It is impossible that one should not see pictures; because if my father was a blacksmith,1,0,6, yours,1,0,35, a peer of the realm, we must needs,1,0,17, pictures to each,1,0,30,. We cannot possibly break out,1,0,56, the frame of the picture by speaking natural words. You,1,0,11, me leaning,3,0,132, of the smithy with a horseshoe in my hand and you think as you go by: "How picturesque!" I, seeing you sitting so much at your ease,1,0,19, the car, almost as,1,0,15, you were going,1,0,107, bow to the populace, think what a picture of old luxurious aristocratical England! We are both quite wrong,1,0,24, our judgments no doubt,,1,0,21, that is inevitable.
,1,0,18,So now at the turn,2,0,15, road I saw one,1,0,30, these pictures. It might have,1,0,7, called,2,0,29, Sailor's Homecoming" or some,1,0,6, title,1,0,124, A fine young sailor carrying a bundle; a girl with her hand on his arm; neighbours gathering round; a cottage garden ablaze,1,0,46, flowers; as one passed one read at the bottom,1,0,86, that picture that the sailor was back from China, and there was a fine spread waiting,1,0,4, him,1,0,34, the parlour; and he had a present,1,0,15, his young wife,1,0,43, his bundle; and she was soon going to bear,1,0,66, their first child. Everything was right and good and as it should,1,0,31,, one felt about that picture.
,1,0,59,There was something wholesome and satisfactory in the sight,1,0,54, such happiness; life seemed sweeter and more enviable,1,0,7, before,1,0,1,
,1,0,73,So thinking I passed them, filling in the picture as fully, as completely,1,0,2, I,1,0,28,, noticing the colour of her,1,0,67,, of his eyes, seeing the sandy cat slinking round the cottage door,1,0,1,
,1,0,36,For some time the picture floated in,1,0,67, eyes, making most things appear much brighter, warmer, and simpler,1,0,55, usual; and making some things appear foolish; and some,1,0,15, wrong and some,2,0,15,, and more full,1,0,20, meaning than before,1,0,7, At odd,1,0,50, during that day and the next the picture returned,1,0,127, one's mind, and one thought with envy, but with kindness, of the happy sailor and his wife; one wondered what they were doing,,2,0,161, were saying now. The imagination supplied other pictures springing from that first one, a picture of the sailor cutting firewood, drawing water; and they talked,1,0,112, China; and the girl set his present on the chimney-piece where everyone who came could see it; and she sewed at,1,0,36, baby clothes, and all the doors and,2,0,93, open into the garden so that the birds were flittering and the bees humming, and Rogers—that,1,0,23, his name—could not say,2,0,62, to his liking all this was after the China seas. As he smoked,1,0,11, pipe, with,1,0,21, foot in the garden.
,1,0,13,In the middle,2,0,30, night a loud cry rang through,1,0,20, village. Then there,1,0,64, a sound of something scuffling; and then dead silence. All that,3,0,87, out of the window was the branch of lilac tree hanging motionless and ponderous across,1,0,5, road,1,0,36, It was a hot still night. There was,1,0,77, moon. The cry made everything seem ominous. Who had cried? Why had she cried,1,0,47, It was a woman's voice, made by some extremity,1,0,46, feeling almost sexless, almost expressionless,1,0,10, It was as,1,0,13, human nature,1,0,6, cried,1,0,65, against some iniquity, some inexpressible horror. There was dead,1,0,63,. The stars shone perfectly steadily. The fields lay still. The,1,0,90, were motionless. Yet all seemed guilty, convicted, ominous. One felt that something ought,1,0,3, be,1,0,18,. Some light ought,1,0,49, appear tossing, moving agitatedly. Someone ought,1,0,41, come running down the road. There should,1,0,31, lights in the cottage windows.,1,0,26, then perhaps another cry,,1,0,89, less sexless, less wordless, comforted, appeased. But no light came. No feet were heard.,1,0,4, was,1,0,64, second cry. The first had been swallowed up, and there was dead,1,0,2,.
,1,0,99,One lay in the dark listening intently. It had been merely a voice. There was nothing to connect it,1,0,70,. No picture of any sort came to interpret it, to make it intelligible,1,0,169, the mind. But as the dark arose at last all one saw was an obscure human form, almost without shape, raising a gigantic arm in vain against some overwhelming iniquity.
,1,0,46,The fine weather remained unbroken. Had it not,2,0,64, that single cry in the night one would have felt that the earth,1,0,39, put into harbour; that life had ceased,1,0,101, drive before the wind; that it had reached some quiet cove and there lay anchored, hardly moving, on,1,0,61, quiet waters. But the sound persisted. Wherever one went, it,1,0,27, be for a long walk up into,1,0,53, hills, something seemed to turn uneasily beneath the,1,0,103,, making the peace, the stability all round one seem a little unreal. There were the sheep clustered on,1,0,5, side,2,0,60, hill; the valley broke in long tapering waves like the fall,1,0,72, smooth waters. One came on solitary farmhouses. The puppy rolled in the,1,0,75,. The butterflies gambolled over the gorse. All was as quiet, as safe could,2,0,47, Yet, one kept thinking, a cry had rent it; all,1,0,182, beauty had been an accomplice that night; had consented; to remain calm, to be still beautiful; at any moment it might be sundered again. This goodness, this safety were only on the,1,0,2,.
,1,0,81,And then to cheer oneself out of this apprehensive mood one turned to the picture,1,0,45, the sailor's homecoming. One saw it all over,1,0,192, producing various little details—the blue colour of her dress, the shadow that fell from the yellow flowering tree—that one had not used before. So they had stood at the cottage door, he with,1,0,10, bundle on,1,0,32, back, she just lightly touching,1,0,12, sleeve with,1,0,5, hand,1,0,130, And a sandy cat had slunk round the door. Thus gradually going over the picture in every detail, one persuaded oneself by degrees,1,0,23, it was far more likely,1,0,52, this calm and content and good will lay beneath the,1,0,167, than anything treacherous, sinister. The sheep grazing, the waves of the valley, the farmhouse, the puppy, the dancing butterflies were in fact like that all through.,2,0,27, one turned back home, with,1,0,13,'s mind fixed,1,0,15, the sailor and,1,0,24, wife, making up picture,3,0,31, them so that one picture after,1,0,114, of happiness and satisfaction might be laid over that unrest, that hideous cry, until it was crushed and silenced,1,0,32, their pressure out of existence,1,0,1,
,1,0,56,Here at last was the village, and the churchyard through,1,0,96, one must pass; and the usual thought came, as one entered it, of the peacefulness of the place,,2,0,12, shady yews,,1,0,19, rubbed tombstones,,1,0,58, nameless graves. Death is cheerful here, one felt. Indeed,1,0,42, look at that picture! A man was digging a,1,0,14,, and children,1,0,23, picnicking at the side,1,0,56, it while he worked. As the shovels of yellow earth were,1,0,32, up, the children were sprawling,1,0,13, eating bread,1,0,26, jam and drinking milk out,1,0,30, large mugs. The gravedigger's,1,0,31,, a fat fair woman, had propped,1,0,20, against a tombstone,1,0,7, spread,1,0,46, apron on the grass by the open grave to serve,1,0,7, a tea-,1,0,67,. Some lumps of clay had fallen among the tea things. Who was going,1,0,28, be buried, I asked. Had old,2,0,33, Dodson died at last? "Oh! no. It,1,0,66, for young Rogers, the sailor," the woman answered, staring at me.,1,0,18,He died two nights,1,0,29,, of some foreign fever. Didn,1,0,31, you hear his wife?" She rushed,1,0,9, the road,1,0,6, cried,1,0,20,..."Here, Tommy, you,1,0,26, all covered with earth!"
,1,0,24,What a picture it made!
,1,0,5,There,1,0,30, moments even in England, now,,1,0,18, even the busiest,,1,0,145, contented suddenly let fall what they hold—it may be the week's washing. Sheets and pyjamas crumble and dissolve in their hands, because, though,1,0,51, do not state this in so many words, it seems silly,1,0,30, take the washing round to Mrs,1,0,61, Peel when out there over the fields over the hills, there is,1,0,73, washing; no pinning of clothes to lines; mangling and ironing no work at,1,0,1,,,1,0,85, boundless rest. Stainless and boundless rest; space unlimited; untrodden grass; wild,1,0,61, flying hills whose smooth uprise continue that wild flight.
,1,0,57,Of all this however only seven foot by four could be seen,1,0,4, Mrs,1,0,5, Grey,1,0,26, corner. That was the size,1,0,32, her front door which stood wide,1,0,36,, though there was a fire burning in,1,0,23, grate. The fire looked,1,0,42, a small spot of dusty light feebly trying,1,0,7, escape,1,0,26, the embarrassing pressure,1,0,23, the pouring sunshine.
,1,0,23,Mrs. Grey sat on a hard,1,0,7, in the,1,0,43, looking—but at what? Apparently at nothing,1,0,32, She did not change the focus of,1,0,48, eyes when visitors came in. Her eyes had ceased,1,0,33, focus themselves; it may be that,1,0,61, had lost the power. They were aged eyes, blue, unspectacled.,1,0,93, could see, but without looking. She had never used her eyes on anything minute and difficult,1,0,42, merely upon faces, and dishes and fields.,1,0,11, now at the,2,0,7, ninety,1,0,20,two they saw nothing,1,0,94, a zigzag of pain wriggling across the door, pain that twisted her legs as it wriggled; jerked,1,0,12, body to and,1,0,28, like a marionette. Her body,1,0,66, wrapped round the pain as a damp sheet is folded over a wire. The,1,0,103, was spasmodically jerked by a cruel invisible hand. She flung out a foot, a hand. Then it stopped. She,1,0,6, still,3,0,2,.
,1,0,32,In that pause she saw herself in,1,0,34, past at ten, at twenty, at twenty,1,0,4,five,1,0,23, She was running in and,2,0,31, a cottage with eleven brothers,2,0,48,. The line jerked. She was thrown forward in her,1,0,2,.
,1,0,10,"All dead.,1,0,20, dead," she mumbled.,1,0,15,My brothers and,1,0,25,. And my husband gone. My,1,0,4, too,1,0,27, But I go on. Every morning,1,0,16, pray God to let,1,0,8, pass."
,1,0,67,The morning spread seven foot by four green and sunny. Like a fling,1,0,58, grain the birds settled on the land. She was jerked again,1,0,39, another tweak of the tormenting hand.
,1,0,2,"I,1,0,39, an ignorant old woman. I can't read or,1,0,84,, and every morning when I crawls down stairs, I say I wish it were night; and every,1,0,78,, when I crawls up to bed, I say, I wish it were day. I'm only an ignorant old,1,0,1,.,1,0,11, I prays to,1,0,36,: 0 let me pass. I'm an ignorant old,1,0,16,—I can't read or,1,0,3,."
,1,0,94,So when the colour went out of the doorway, she could not see the other page which is then lit,1,0,44,; or hear the voices that have argued, sung,,1,0,13, for hundreds,1,0,8, years.
,1,0,16,The jerked limbs,2,0,8, again.
,1,0,58,"The doctor comes every week. The parish doctor now. Since,1,0,34, daughter went, we can't afford Dr,1,0,39, Nicholls. But he's a good man. He says,1,0,14, wonders I don,1,0,40, go. He says my heart's nothing but wind,1,0,17, water. Yet I don,1,0,10, seem able,1,0,7, die."
,1,0,14,So we—humanity,1,0,6,insist,1,0,27, the body shall still cling,1,0,30, the wire. We put out the eyes,1,0,4, the,1,0,1,;,1,0,53, we pinion it there, with a bottle of medicine, a cup,2,0,89,, a dying fire, like a rook on a barn door; but a rook that still lives, even with a nail,1,0,3, it,1,0,1,
,1,0,18,No one perhaps has,2,0,40, passionately towards a lead pencil. But,2,0,17, circumstances in,1,0,58, it can become supremely desirable to possess one; moments,1,0,44, we are set upon having an object, an excuse,1,0,83, walking half across London between tea and dinner. As the foxhunter hunts in order,1,0,80, preserve the breed of foxes, and the golfer plays in order that open spaces may,1,0,186, preserved from the builders, so when the desire comes upon us to go street rambling the pencil does for a pretext, and getting up we say: "Really I must buy a pencil," as if under cover,1,0,36, this excuse we could indulge safely,1,0,78, the greatest pleasure of town life in winter—rambling the streets of London.
,1,0,95,The hour should be the evening and the season winter, for in winter the champagne brightness of,1,0,8, air and,1,0,12, sociability,1,0,82, the streets are grateful. We are not then taunted as in the summer by the longing,1,0,6, shade,1,0,66, solitude and sweet airs from the hayfields. The evening hour, too,1,0,6, gives,1,0,58, the irresponsibility which darkness and lamplight bestow.,1,0,7, are no,1,0,76, quite ourselves. As we step out of the house on a fine evening between four,2,0,35,, we shed the self our friends know,1,0,19, by and become part,1,0,98, that vast republican army of anonymous trampers, whose society is so agreeable after the solitude,1,0,4, one,1,0,38, own room. For there we sit surrounded,1,0,45, objects which perpetually express the oddity,1,0,103, our own temperaments and enforce the memories of our own experience. That bowl on the mantelpiece, for,2,0,112, was bought at Mantua on a windy day. We were leaving the shop when the sinister old woman plucked at our skirts,1,0,50, said she would find herself starving one of these,1,0,69,, but, "Take it!" she cried, and thrust the blue and white china bowl,1,0,33, our hands as if she never wanted,1,0,15, be reminded of,1,0,34, quixotic generosity. So, guiltily,1,0,78, but suspecting nevertheless how badly we had been fleeced, we carried it back,1,0,38, the little hotel where, in the middle,1,0,4, the,2,0,28, the innkeeper quarrelled so,2,0,9, his wife,1,0,22, we all leant out into,1,0,90, courtyard to look, and saw the vines laced about among the pillars and the stars white in,3,0,115, The moment was stabilized, stamped like a coin indelibly among a million that slipped by imperceptibly. There, too,1,0,62, was the melancholy Englishman, who rose among the coffee cups,1,0,48, the little iron tables and revealed the secrets,2,0,124, soul—as travellers do. All this—Italy, the windy morning, the vines laced about the pillars, the Englishman and the secrets,2,0,10, soul—rise,1,0,62, in a cloud from the china bowl on the mantelpiece. And there,,1,0,17, our eyes fall to,1,0,45, floor, is that brown stain on the carpet. Mr,1,0,45, Lloyd George made that. "The man's a devil!",1,0,3, Mr,1,0,45, Cummings, putting the kettle down with which,1,0,10, was about,1,0,62, fill the teapot so that it burnt a brown ring on the carpet.
,1,0,12,But when the,1,0,12, shuts on us,1,0,30, all that vanishes. The shell-,1,0,100, covering which our souls have excreted to house themselves, to make for themselves a shape distinct,1,0,59, others, is broken, and there is left of all these wrinkles,1,0,208, roughnesses a central oyster of perceptiveness, an enormous eye. How beautiful a street is in winter! It is at once revealed and obscured. Here vaguely one can trace symmetrical straight avenues of doors and,1,0,12,; here under,1,0,83, lamps are floating islands of pale light through which pass quickly bright men and,1,0,14,, who, for all,1,0,8, poverty,1,0,11, shabbiness,1,0,41, wear a certain look of unreality, an air,1,0,12, triumph, as,1,0,5, they,1,0,56, given life the slip, so that life, deceived of her prey,1,0,41, blunders on without them. But, after all,1,0,82, we are only gliding smoothly on the surface. The eye is not a miner, not a diver,,2,0,20, seeker after buried,2,0,94, It floats us smoothly down a stream; resting, pausing, the brain sleeps perhaps as it looks.
,1,0,43,How beautiful a London street is then, with,1,0,22, islands of light, and,1,0,36, long groves of darkness, and on one,1,0,174, of it perhaps some tree-sprinkled, grass-grown space where night is folding herself to sleep naturally and, as one passes the iron railing, one hears those little cracklings,1,0,38, stirrings of leaf and twig which seem,1,0,62, suppose the silence of fields all round them, an owl hooting,,1,0,4, far,1,0,11, the rattle,1,0,148, a train in the valley. But this is London, we are reminded; high among the bare trees are hung oblong frames of reddish yellow light—windows; there,1,0,79, points of brilliance burning steadily like low stars—lamps; this empty ground,,1,0,161, holds the country in it and its peace, is only a London square, set about by offices and houses where at this hour fierce lights burn over maps, over documents,,1,0,173, desks where clerks sit turning with wetted forefinger the files of endless correspondences; or more suffusedly the firelight wavers and the lamplight falls upon the privacy,1,0,14, some drawing-,1,0,18,, its easy chairs,,1,0,8, papers,,1,0,7, china,,1,0,34, inlaid table, and the figure of a,1,0,45,, accurately measuring out the precise number,1,0,49, spoons of tea which——She looks at the door as if,1,0,57, heard a ring downstairs and somebody asking, is she in?
,1,0,35,But here we must stop peremptorily.,1,0,14, are in danger,1,0,104, digging deeper than the eye approves; we are impeding our passage down the smooth stream by catching at,1,0,143, branch or root. At any moment, the sleeping army may stir itself and wake in us a thousand violins and trumpets in response; the army of human,1,0,32, may rouse itself and assert all,1,0,9, oddities,1,0,32, sufferings and sordidities. Let,1,0,40, dally a little longer, be content still,1,0,36, surfaces only—the glossy brilliance,1,0,42, the motor omnibuses; the carnal splendour,1,0,45, the butchers' shops with their yellow flanks,1,0,78, purple steaks; the blue and red bunches of flowers burning so bravely through,1,0,39, plate glass of the florists' windows.
,1,0,52,For the eye has this strange property: it rests only,1,0,41, beauty; like a butterfly it seeks colour,1,0,6, basks,1,0,22, warmth. On a winter's,1,0,5, like,2,0,30, when nature has been at pains,1,0,89, polish and preen herself, it brings back the prettiest trophies, breaks off little lumps,1,0,40, emerald and coral as if the whole earth,1,0,136, made of precious stone. The thing it cannot do (one is speaking of the average unprofessional eye) is to compose these trophies in such,2,0,3, as,1,0,34, bring out the more obscure angles,1,0,44, relationships. Hence after a prolonged diet,1,0,41, this simple, sugary fare, of beauty pure,1,0,32, uncomposed, we become conscious,1,0,93, satiety. We halt at the door of the boot shop and make some little excuse, which has nothing,3,0,72, the real reason, for folding up the bright paraphernalia of the streets,1,0,70, withdrawing to some duskier chamber of the being where we may ask, as,1,0,6, raise,1,0,5, left,1,0,27, obediently upon the stand:,1,0,10,What, then,1,0,28, is it like to be a dwarf?"
,1,0,20,She came in escorted,2,0,6, women,1,0,22,, being of normal size,1,0,7, looked,1,0,25, benevolent giants beside,2,0,57, Smiling at the shop girls, they seemed to be disclaiming,1,0,21, lot in her deformity,1,0,9, assuring,1,0,87, of their protection. She wore the peevish yet apologetic expression usual on the faces,1,0,45, the deformed. She needed their kindness, yet,1,0,175, resented it. But when the shop girl had been summoned and the giantesses, smiling indulgently, had asked for shoes for "this lady" and the girl had pushed the little stand in,3,0,63,, the dwarf stuck her foot out with an impetuosity which seemed,1,0,6, claim,1,0,20, our attention. Look,1,0,11, that! Look,3,0,46, she seemed to demand of us all, as she thrust,1,0,79, foot out, for behold it was the shapely, perfectly proportioned foot of a well,1,0,76,grown woman. It was arched; it was aristocratic. Her whole manner changed as,1,0,54, looked at it resting on the stand. She looked soothed,1,0,34, satisfied. Her manner became full,1,0,5, self,1,0,35,confidence. She sent for shoe after,1,0,1,;,1,0,26, tried on pair after pair.,1,0,118, got up and pirouetted before a glass which reflected the foot only in yellow shoes, in fawn shoes, in shoes of lizard,1,0,12,. She raised,1,0,28, little skirts and displayed,1,0,13, little legs.,1,0,63, was thinking that, after all, feet are the most important part,1,0,99, the whole person; women, she said to herself, have been loved for their feet alone. Seeing nothing,1,0,4, her,1,0,1,,,1,0,31, imagined perhaps that the rest,1,0,24, her body was of a piece,1,0,39, those beautiful feet. She was shabbily,1,0,1,,,2,0,10, was ready,1,0,22, lavish any money upon,1,0,46, shoes. And as this was the only occasion upon,1,0,19, she was hot afraid,2,0,57, looked at but positively craved attention, she was ready,1,0,57, use any device to prolong the choosing and fitting. Look,1,0,37, my feet, she seemed to be saying, as,1,0,21, took a step this way,2,0,2, a,1,0,45, that way. The shop girl good-humouredly must,1,0,53, said something flattering, for suddenly her face lit,1,0,12, in ecstasy.,1,0,46,, after all, the giantesses, benevolent though,1,0,5, were,1,0,50, had their own affairs to see to; she must make up,2,0,1,;,2,0,131, decide which to choose. At length, the pair was chosen and, as she walked out between her guardians, with the parcel swinging from,1,0,99, finger, the ecstasy faded, knowledge returned, the old peevishness, the old apology came back, and,1,0,72, the time she had reached the street again she had become a dwarf only.
,1,0,29,But she had changed the mood;,1,0,46, had called into being an atmosphere which, as,1,0,22, followed her out into,1,0,72, street, seemed actually to create the humped, the twisted, the deformed,1,0,12, Two bearded,1,0,58,, brothers, apparently, stone-blind, supporting themselves,1,0,15, resting a hand,1,0,9, the head,1,0,8, a small,1,0,27, between them, marched down,1,0,61, street. On they came with the unyielding yet tremulous tread,1,0,23, the blind, which seems,1,0,8, lend to,1,0,22, approach something of,1,0,25, terror and inevitability,1,0,37, the fate that has overtaken them. As,1,0,54, passed, holding straight on, the little convoy seemed,1,0,28, cleave asunder the passers-,1,0,50, with the momentum of its silence, its directness,,1,0,9, disaster,1,0,7, Indeed,1,0,71, the dwarf had started a hobbling grotesque dance to which everybody in,1,0,84, street now conformed: the stout lady tightly swathed in shiny sealskin; the feeble-,1,0,31, boy sucking the silver knob of,1,0,15, stick; the old,1,0,48, squatted on a doorstep as if, suddenly overcome,1,0,14, the absurdity,1,0,32, the human spectacle, he had sat,1,0,8, to look,1,0,49, it—all joined in the hobble and tap of the dwarf,1,0,8, dance.
,1,0,49,In what crevices and crannies, one might ask, did,1,0,68, lodge, this maimed company of the halt and the blind? Here, perhaps,1,0,17, in the top rooms,1,0,40, these narrow old houses between Holborn,1,0,130, Soho, where people have such queer names, and pursue so many curious trades, are gold beaters, accordion pleaters, cover buttons,,1,0,192, support life, with even greater fantasticality, upon a traffic in cups without saucers, china umbrella handles, and highly-coloured pictures of martyred saints. There they lodge, and it seems,1,0,85, if the lady in the sealskin jacket must find life tolerable, passing the time of day,1,0,34, the accordion pleater, or the man,1,0,50, covers buttons; life which is so fantastic cannot,1,0,18, altogether tragic,1,0,8, They do,1,0,57, grudge us, we are musing, our prosperity; when, suddenly,1,0,12, turning the,1,0,96,, we come upon a bearded Jew, wild, hunger-bitten, glaring out of his misery; or pass the humped,1,0,10, of an old,1,0,19, flung abandoned on,1,0,79, step of a public building with a cloak over her like the hasty covering thrown,1,0,53, a dead horse or donkey. At such sights the nerves of,1,0,11, spine seem,1,0,69, stand erect; a sudden flare is brandished in our eyes; a question is,1,0,15, which is never,1,0,37,. Often enough these derelicts choose,1,0,152, lie not a stone's thrown from theatres, within hearing of barrel organs, almost, as night draws on, within touch of the sequined cloaks and bright legs,1,0,7, diners,1,0,144, dancers. They lie close to those shop windows where commerce offers to a world of old women laid on doorsteps, of blind men, of hobbling dwarfs,1,0,26, sofas which are supported,1,0,45, the gilt necks of proud swans; tables inlaid,1,0,8, baskets,1,0,38, many coloured fruit; sideboards paved,1,0,24, green marble the better,1,0,19, support the weight,1,0,47, boars' heads; and carpets so softened with age,1,0,38, their carnations have almost vanished,1,0,19, a pale green sea.
,1,0,185,Passing, glimpsing, everything seems accidentally but miraculously sprinkled with beauty, as if the tide of trade which deposits its burden so punctually and prosaically upon the shores,1,0,45, Oxford Street had this night cast up nothing,1,0,57, treasure. With no thought of buying, the eye is sportive,1,0,22, generous; it creates;,1,0,7, adorns,2,0,94, enhances. Standing out in the street, one may build up all the chambers of an imaginary house,1,0,290, furnish them at one's will with sofa, table, carpet. That rug will do for the hall. That alabaster bowl shall stand on a carved table in the window. Our merrymaking shall be reflected in that thick round mirror. But, having built and furnished the house, one is happily under no obligation,1,0,30, possess it; one can dismantle,1,0,17, in the twinkling,3,0,55,, and build and furnish another house with other chairs,1,0,22, other glasses. Or let,1,0,69, indulge ourselves at the antique jewellers, among the trays of rings,1,0,27, the hanging necklaces. Let,1,0,59, choose those pearls, for example, and then imagine how, if,1,0,18, put them on, life,1,0,62, be changed. It becomes instantly between two and three in the,2,0,33, the lamps are burning very white,1,0,13, the deserted,2,0,8, Mayfair,1,0,30, Only motor-cars are abroad at,1,0,26, hour, and one has a sense,1,0,24, emptiness, of airiness,,1,0,16, secluded gaiety,1,0,47, Wearing pearls, wearing silk, one steps out on,1,0,26, a balcony which overlooks,1,0,35, gardens of sleeping Mayfair. There,1,0,16, a few lights in,1,0,174, bedrooms of great peers returned from Court, of silk-stockinged footmen, of dowagers who have pressed the hands of statesmen. A cat creeps along the garden wall. Love-making,1,0,6, going,1,0,45, sibilantly, seductively in the darker places,1,0,37, the room behind thick green curtains,1,0,135, Strolling sedately as if he were promenading a terrace beneath which the shires and counties of England lie sun-bathed, the aged Prime,1,0,24, recounts to Lady So-and,1,0,17,So with the curls,1,0,30, the emeralds the true history,1,0,18, some great crisis,1,0,12, the affairs,1,0,10, the land.,1,0,5, seem,1,0,21, be riding on the top,1,0,20, the highest mast of,1,0,29, tallest ship; and yet at the,2,0,29, we know that nothing of this,1,0,159, matters; love is not proved thus, nor great achievements completed thus; so that we sport with the moment and preen our feathers in it lightly, as we stand on,1,0,17, balcony watching,1,0,38, moonlit cat creep along Princess Mary,1,0,14, garden wall.
,1,0,40,But what could be more absurd? It is, in,2,0,14, on the stroke,1,0,49, six; it is a winter's evening; we are walking to,1,0,29, Strand to buy a pencil. How,,2,0,4, are,1,0,62, also on a balcony, wearing pearls in June? What could be more,1,0,18,? Yet it is nature,1,0,7, folly,,1,0,59, ours. When she set about her chief masterpiece, the making,1,0,88, man, she should have thought of one thing only. Instead, turning her head, looking over,2,0,15,, into each one,1,0,69, us she let creep instincts and desires which are utterly at variance,1,0,176, his main being, so that we are streaked, variegated, all of a mixture; the colours have run. Is the true self this which stands on the pavement in January, or that which bends,1,0,12, the balcony,1,0,9, June? Am,1,0,9, here, or,2,0,40, there? Or is the true self neither this,2,0,14,, neither here,2,0,25,, but something so varied,1,0,31, wandering that it is only when,1,0,28, give the rein to its wishes,1,0,12, let it take,1,0,138, way unimpeded that we are indeed ourselves? Circumstances compel unity; for convenience sake a man must be a whole. The good citizen when,1,0,6, opens,1,0,149, door in the evening must be banker, golfer, husband, father; not a nomad wandering the desert, a mystic staring at the sky, a debauchee in the slums,1,0,108, San Francisco, a soldier heading a revolution, a pariah howling with scepticism and solitude. When he opens,1,0,30, door, he must run his fingers,4,0,4, put,1,0,31, umbrella in the stand like the,1,0,2,.
,1,0,60,But here, none too soon, are the second-hand bookshops. Here,1,0,43, find anchorage in these thwarting currents,1,0,12, being; here,1,0,52, balance ourselves after the splendours and miseries,1,0,28, the streets. The very sight,1,0,27, the bookseller's wife with,1,0,5, foot,1,0,81, the fender, sitting beside a good coal fire, screened from the door, is sobering,1,0,9, cheerful,1,0,92, She is never reading, or only the newspaper; her talk, when it leaves bookselling, which it,1,0,77, so gladly, is about hats; she likes a hat to be practical, she says, as well,1,0,19, pretty. 0 no, they,2,0,18, live at the shop;,1,0,37, live in Brixton; she must have a bit,1,0,14, green to look,1,0,72,. In summer a jar of flowers grown in her own garden is stood on the top,1,0,85, some dusty pile to enliven the shop. Books are everywhere; and always the same sense,1,0,63, adventure fills us. Second-hand books are wild books, homeless,1,0,1,;,1,0,234, have come together in vast flocks of variegated feather, and have a charm which the domesticated volumes of the library lack. Besides, in this random miscellaneous company we may rub against some complete stranger who will, with luck,1,0,41, turn into the best friend we have in the,1,0,96,. There is always a hope, as we reach down some grayish-white book from an upper shelf, directed,1,0,22, its air of shabbiness,1,0,38, desertion, of meeting here with a man,1,0,42, set out on horseback over a hundred years,2,0,43, explore the woollen market in the Midlands,1,0,29, Wales; an unknown traveller,,1,0,7, stayed,1,0,75, inns, drank his pint, noted pretty girls and serious customs, wrote it all,1,0,36, stiffly, laboriously for sheer love,1,0,27, it (the book was published,1,0,8, his own,1,0,41,); was infinitely prosy, busy, and matter,4,0,40,, and so let flow in without his knowing,1,0,15, the very scent,1,0,11, hollyhocks,1,0,38, the hay together with such a portrait,1,0,17, himself as gives,1,0,18, forever a seat in,1,0,12, warm corner,1,0,62, the mind's inglenook. One may buy him for eighteen pence now.,1,0,94, is marked three and sixpence, but the bookseller's wife, seeing how shabby the covers are and,1,0,78, long the book has stood there since it was bought at some sale of a gentleman,1,0,45, library in Suffolk, will let it go at that.
,1,0,83,Thus, glancing round the bookshop, we make other such sudden capricious friendships,1,0,55, the unknown and the vanished whose only record is, for,2,0,87, this little book of poems, so fairly printed, so finely engraved, too, with a portrait,1,0,30, the author. For he was a poet,1,0,41, drowned untimely, and his verse, mild as,1,0,79, is and formal and sententious, sends forth still a frail fluty sound like that,1,0,112, a piano organ played in some back street resignedly by an old Italian organ-grinder in a corduroy jacket. There,1,0,21, travellers, too, row,3,0,51, them, still testifying, indomitable spinsters that,1,0,113, were, to the discomforts that they endured and the sunsets they admired in Greece when Queen Victoria was a girl,1,0,68, A tour in Cornwall with a visit to the tin mines was thought worthy,1,0,38, voluminous record. People went slowly,1,0,95, the Rhine and did portraits of each other in Indian ink, sitting reading on deck beside a coil,1,0,126, rope; they measured the pyramids; were lost to civilization for years; converted negroes in pestilential swamps. This packing,1,0,33, and going off, exploring deserts,1,0,35, catching fevers, settling in India,1,0,57, a lifetime, penetrating even to China and then returning,1,0,199, lead a parochial life at Edmonton, tumbles and tosses upon the dusty floor like an uneasy sea, so restless the English are, with the waves at their very door. The waters of travel and adventure seem,1,0,242, break upon little islands of serious effort and lifelong industry stood in jagged column upon the floor. In these piles of puce-bound volumes with gilt monograms on the back, thoughtful clergymen expound the gospels; scholars are to be heard,1,0,78, their hammers and their chisels chipping clear the ancient texts of Euripides,1,0,226, Aeschylus. Thinking, annotating, expounding goes on at a prodigious rate all around us and over everything, like a punctual, everlasting tide, washes the ancient sea of fiction. Innumerable volumes tell how Arthur loved Laura,1,0,85, they were separated and they were unhappy and then they met and they were happy ever,1,0,52,, as was the way when Victoria ruled these islands.
,1,0,10,The number,1,0,50, books in the world is infinite, and one is forced,1,0,60, glimpse and nod and move on after a moment of talk, a flash,1,0,72, understanding, as, in the street outside, one catches a word in passing,1,0,138, from a chance phrase fabricates a lifetime. It is about a woman called Kate that they are talking, how "I said to her quite straight last,1,0,9,...if you,2,0,8, think I,1,0,56, worth a penny stamp, I said..." But who Kate is, and to,1,0,105, crisis in their friendship that penny stamp refers, we shall never know; for Kate sinks under the warmth,1,0,17, their volubility,1,0,93, and here, at the street corner, another page of the volume of life is laid open by the sight,1,0,58, two men consulting under the lamp-post. They are spelling,1,0,75, the latest wire from Newmarket in the stop press news. Do they think, then,2,0,8, fortune,1,0,24, ever convert their rags,1,0,4, fur,1,0,18, broadcloth, sling,1,0,149, with watch-chains, and plant diamond pins where there is now a ragged open shirt? But the main stream of walkers at this hour sweeps too fast to let,1,0,9, ask such,1,0,61,. They are wrapt, in this short passage from work to home, in,1,0,77, narcotic dream, now that they are free from the desk, and have the fresh air,1,0,106, their cheeks. They put on those bright clothes which they must hang up and lock the key upon all the rest,1,0,103, the day, and are great cricketers, famous actresses, soldiers who have saved their country at the hour,1,0,93, need. Dreaming, gesticulating, often muttering a few words aloud, they sweep over the Strand,1,0,163, across Waterloo Bridge whence they will be slung in long rattling trains, to some prim little villa in Barnes or Surbiton where the sight of the clock in the hall,1,0,10, the smell,1,0,48, the supper in the basement puncture the dream.
,1,0,15,But we are come,1,0,78, the Strand now, and as we hesitate on the curb, a little rod about the length,1,0,6, one's,1,0,56, begins to lay its bar across the velocity and abundance,1,0,30, life. "Really I must—really I,1,0,111,"—that is it. Without investigating the demand, the mind cringes to the accustomed tyrant. One must, one always,1,0,53,, do something or other; it is not allowed one simply,1,0,42, enjoy oneself. Was it not for this reason,1,0,11,, some time,3,0,50, fabricated the excuse, and invented the necessity,1,0,55, buying something? But what was it? Ah, we remember, it,1,0,126, a pencil. Let us go then and buy this pencil. But just as we are turning to obey the command, another self disputes the right,1,0,11, the tyrant,1,0,99, insist. The usual conflict comes about. Spread out behind the rod of duty we see the whole breadth,1,0,43, the river Thames—wide, mournful, peaceful.,1,0,27, we see it through the eyes,1,0,56, somebody who is leaning over the Embankment on a summer,1,0,16,, without a care,3,0,5,. Let,1,0,47, put off buying the pencil; let us go in search,1,0,41, this person—and soon it becomes apparent,1,0,73, this person is ourselves. For if we could stand there where we stood six,2,0,30,, should we not be again as we,1,0,17, then—calm, aloof,1,0,62, content? Let us try then. But the river is rougher and greyer,1,0,35, we remembered. The tide is running,1,0,28, to sea. It brings down with,1,0,6, a tug,1,0,94, two barges, whose load of straw is tightly bound down beneath tarpaulin covers. There is, too,1,0,72, close by us, a couple leaning over the balustrade with the curious lack,1,0,5, self,1,0,47,consciousness lovers have, as if the importance,1,0,70, the affair they are engaged on claims without question the indulgence,1,0,30, the human race. The sights we,1,0,8, and the,3,0,14, now have none,1,0,47, the quality of the past; nor have we any share,1,0,13, the serenity,1,0,11, the person,1,0,5,, six,1,0,4, ago,1,0,30, stood precisely were we stand,1,0,52,. His is the happiness of death; ours the insecurity,1,0,56, life. He has no future; the future is even now invading,1,0,23, peace. It is only when,1,0,31, look at the past and take from,1,0,27, the element of uncertainty,1,0,55, we can enjoy perfect peace. As it is, we must turn, we,1,0,6, cross,1,0,17, Strand again, we,1,0,38, find a shop where, even at this hour,,1,0,36, will be ready to sell us a pencil.
,1,0,74,It is always an adventure to enter a new room for the lives and characters,1,0,26, its owners have distilled,1,0,11, atmosphere,1,0,81, it, and directly we enter it we breast some new wave of emotion. Here, without a,2,0,17, in the stationer,1,0,51, shop people had been quarrelling. Their anger shot,1,0,60, the air. They both stopped; the old woman—they were husband,2,0,130, evidently—retired to a back room; the old man whose rounded forehead and globular eyes would have looked well on the frontispiece,1,0,57, some Elizabethan folio, stayed to serve us. "A pencil, a,1,0,39,," he repeated, "certainly, certainly.",1,0,66, spoke with the distraction yet effusiveness of one whose emotions,1,0,39, been roused and checked in full flood.,1,0,24, began opening box after,1,0,45, and shutting them again. He said that it was,1,0,93, difficult to find things when they kept so many different articles. He launched into a story,1,0,21, some legal gentleman,1,0,31, had got into deep waters owing,1,0,12, the conduct,1,0,60, his wife. He had known him for years; he had been connected,1,0,20, the Temple for half,2,0,69,, he said, as if he wished his wife in the back room to overhear him.,1,0,53, upset a box of rubber bands. At last, exasperated by,1,0,13, incompetence,2,0,22, pushed the swing door,2,0,7, called,1,0,9, roughly:,1,0,8,Where d',1,0,17, keep the pencils,1,0,3, as,1,0,67, his wife had hidden them. The old lady came in. Looking at nobody,,1,0,4, put,1,0,143, hand with a fine air of righteous severity upon the right box. There were pencils. How then could he do without her? Was she not indispensable,1,0,4, him,1,0,9, In order,1,0,5, keep,1,0,21, there, standing side,2,0,30, in forced neutrality, one had,1,0,30, be particular in one's choice,1,0,86, pencils; this was too soft, that too hard. They stood silently looking on. The longer,1,0,6, stood,3,0,7, calmer,1,0,27, grew; their heat was going,1,0,1,,,1,0,55, anger disappearing. Now, without a word said on either,1,0,39,, the quarrel was made up. The old man,,1,0,135, would not have disgraced Ben Jonson's title-page, reached the box back to its proper place, bowed profoundly his good-night to us, and,1,0,148, disappeared. She would get out her sewing; he would read his newspaper; the canary would scatter them impartially with seed. The quarrel was over.
,1,0,141,In these minutes in which a ghost has been sought for, a quarrel composed, and a pencil bought, the streets had become completely empty. Life,1,0,38, withdrawn to the top floor, and lamps,2,0,14,. The pavement,1,0,4, dry,1,0,60, hard; the road was of hammered silver. Walking home through,1,0,44, desolation one could tell oneself the story,1,0,32, the dwarf, of the blind men, of,1,0,62, party in the Mayfair mansion, of the quarrel in the stationer,1,0,69, shop. Into each of these lives one could penetrate a little way, far,1,0,29, to give oneself the illusion,1,0,20, one is not tethered,1,0,15, a single mind,,1,0,58, can put on briefly for a few minutes the bodies and minds,1,0,68, others. One could become a washerwoman, a publican, a street singer,2,0,42, what greater delight and wonder can there,1,0,81, than to leave the straight lines of personality and deviate into those footpaths,1,0,22, lead beneath brambles,1,0,33, thick tree trunks into the heart,3,0,47, where live those wild beasts, our fellow men?
,1,0,151,That is true: to escape is the greatest of pleasures; street haunting in winter the greatest of adventures. Still as we approach our own doorstep again,1,0,17, it is comforting,1,0,30, feel the old possessions, the,1,0,47, prejudices, fold us round; and the self, which,1,0,23, been blown about at so,1,0,7, street,1,0,45,, which has battered like a moth at the flame,1,0,3, so,1,0,113, inaccessible lanterns, sheltered and enclosed. Here again is the usual door; here the chair turned as we left it,1,0,34, the china bowl and the brown ring,1,0,53, the carpet. And here—let us examine it tenderly, let,1,0,60, touch it with reverence—is the only spoil we have retrieved,1,0,47, all the treasures of the city, a lead pencil.
,1,0,42,Whether Jones should come before Wilkinson,1,0,46, Wilkinson before Jones is not a matter likely,1,0,61, agitate many breasts at the present moment, seeing that more,1,0,69, a hundred and fifty years have rolled over the gentlemen in question,1,0,50, diminished a lustre which, even in their own time,1,0,56, round about the year 1750, was not very bright. The Rev,1,0,3, Dr,1,0,50, Wilkinson might indeed claim precedence by virtue,1,0,31, his office. He was His Majesty,1,0,43, Chaplain of the Savoy and Chaplain also to,1,0,41, late Royal Highness, Frederick Prince of,2,0,73, But then Dr. Wilkinson was transported. Captain James Jones might assert,1,0,19,, as Captain of His,2,0,52, third regiment of Guards with a residence by virtue,1,0,58, his office in Savoy Square, his social position was equal,1,0,11, the Doctor,1,0,34,. But Captain Jones had to seclude,1,0,17, beyond the reach,1,0,35, the law at Mortlake. What, however,1,0,51, renders these comparisons peculiarly odious is the,2,0,27, the Captain and the Doctor,1,0,59, boon companions whose tastes were congenial, whose incomes,1,0,103, insufficient, whose wives drank tea together, and whose houses in the Savoy were not two hundred yards,1,0,4,. Dr,1,0,19, Wilkinson, for all,1,0,30, sacred offices (he was Rector,1,0,39, Coyty in Glamorgan, stipendiary curate,1,0,39, Wise in Kent, and, through Lord Galway,1,0,14, had the right,1,0,34, "open plaister-pits in the honour,1,0,56, Pontefract"), was a convivial spirit who cut a splendid,1,0,75, in the pulpit, preached and read prayers in a voice that was clear, strong,1,0,178, sonorous so that many a lady of fashion never "missed her pew near the pulpit," and persons of title remembered him many years after misfortune had removed the handsome preacher,1,0,14, their sight.
,1,0,28,Captain Jones shared many of,1,0,7, friend,1,0,35, qualities. He was vivacious, witty,1,0,83, and generous, well made and elegant in person and, if he was not quite as handsome,1,0,93, the doctor, he was perhaps rather his superior in intellect. Compare them as we may, however,1,0,10, there can,1,0,7, little,2,0,21, the gifts and tastes,1,0,48, both gentlemen were better adapted for pleasure,1,0,29, for labour, for society than,1,0,40, solitude, for the hazards and pleasures,1,0,17, the table rather,1,0,16, for the rigours,1,0,17, religion and war,1,0,3, It,1,0,60, the gaming-table that seduced Captain Jones, and here, alas,1,0,76, his gifts and graces stood him in little stead. His affairs became more and,1,0,49, hopelessly embarrassed, so that shortly, instead,1,0,11, being able,1,0,39, take his walks at large, he was forced,1,0,11, limit them,1,0,20, the precincts of St,1,0,6, James,1,0,31,, where, by ancient prerogative,1,0,54, such unfortunates as he were free from the attentions,1,0,15, the bailiffs.
,1,0,80,To so gregarious a spirit the confinement was irksome. His only resource, indeed,2,0,17, to get into talk,1,0,50, any such "parksaunterers" as misfortunes like his,1,0,65, had driven to perambulate the Park, or, when the weather allowed,1,0,56, to bask and loiter and gossip on its benches. As chance,3,0,31, (and the Captain was a devotee,1,0,35, that goddess) he found himself one,1,0,71, resting on the same bench with an elderly gentleman of military aspect,1,0,279, stern demeanour, whose ill-temper the wit and humour which all allowed to Captain Jones presumably beguiled, so that whenever the Captain appeared in the Park, the old man sought his company, and they passed the time until dinner very pleasantly in talk. On no occasion, however,1,0,32, did the General—for it appeared,1,0,109, the name of this morose old man was General Skelton—ask Captain Jones to his house; the acquaintance went no,1,0,21, than the bench in St,1,0,6, James,2,0,63,; and when, as soon fell out, the Captain's difficulties forced,2,0,20, the greater privacy,1,0,112, a little cabin at Mortlake, he forgot entirely the military gentleman who, presumably, still sought an appetite,1,0,43, dinner or some alleviation of his own sour,1,0,58, in loitering and gossiping with the park-saunterers of St,1,0,6, James,1,0,2,.
,1,0,37,But among the amiable characteristics,1,0,33, Captain Jones was a love of wife,1,0,31, child, scarcely to be wondered,1,0,8,, indeed,1,0,21, considering his wife,1,0,66, lively and entertaining disposition and the extraordinary promise,1,0,34, that little girl who was later to,1,0,9, the wife,1,0,16, Lord Cornwallis,1,0,71, At whatever risk to himself, Captain Jones would steal back to revisit,1,0,85, wife and to hear his little girl recite the part of Juliet which, under his teaching,2,0,104, had perfectly by heart. On one such secret journey he was hurrying to get within the royal sanctuary of,1,0,7,. James,1,0,13, when a voice,1,0,3, on,1,0,29, to stop. His fears obsessing,1,0,49,, he hurried the faster, his pursuer close at his,2,0,37, Realizing that escape was impossible,1,0,49, Jones wheeled about and facing his pursuer, whom,1,0,11, recognized,1,0,54, the Attorney Brown, demanded what his enemy wanted of,1,0,10,. Far from,1,0,10, his enemy,1,0,35, said Brown, he was the best friend,1,0,4, had,1,0,26, had, which he would prove,1,0,22, Jones would accompany,1,0,80, to the first tavern that came to hand. There, in a private room over a fire, Mr,1,0,76, Brown disclosed the following astonishing story. An unknown friend, he said,1,0,26, who had scrutinized Jones,1,0,18, conduct carefully,1,0,15, concluded that,1,0,19, deserts outweighed,1,0,28, misdemeanours, was prepared,1,0,60, settle all his debts and indeed to put him beyond the reach,1,0,93, such tormentors in future. At these words a load was lifted from Jones's heart, and he cried,1,0,46, "Good God! Who can this paragon of friendship,1,0,14,?" It was none,1,0,120,, said Brown, than General Skelton. General Skelton, the man whom he had only met to chat with on a bench in St. James's,1,0,32,? Jones asked in wonderment. Yes,1,0,3, it,1,0,27, the General, Brown assured,1,0,10,. Then let,1,0,40, hasten to throw himself in gratitude at,1,0,26, benefactor's knee! Not so,1,0,56,, Brown replied; General Skelton will never speak to you,2,0,26, General Skelton died last,1,0,2,.
,1,0,10,The extent,1,0,14, Captain Jones,1,0,5, good,1,0,23, was indeed magnificent,1,0,52, The General had left Captain Jones sole heir to all,1,0,34, possessions on no other condition,2,0,3, he,1,0,16, assume the name,1,0,16, Skelton instead,1,0,6, Jones,1,0,29, Hastening through streets no,1,0,47, dreadful, since every debt of honour could now,1,0,32, paid, Captain Jones brought his,1,0,35, the astonishing news of their good,1,0,5,, and,1,0,53, promptly set out to view that part which lay nearest,1,0,85, hand—the General's great house in Henrietta Street. Gazing about her, half in dream,,2,0,13, earnest, Mrs,1,0,156, Jones Was so overcome with the tumult of her emotions that she could not stay to gather in the extent of her possessions, but ran to Little Bedford Street,,1,0,4, Mrs,1,0,19, Wilkinson was then,1,0,30,, to impart her joy. Meanwhile,1,0,84, the news that General Skelton lay dead in Henrietta Street without a son to succeed,1,0,25, spread abroad, and those,1,0,50, thought themselves his heirs arrived in the house,1,0,20, death to take stock,1,0,25, their inheritance, among,1,0,43, one great and beautiful lady whose avarice,1,0,42, her undoing, whose misfortunes were equal,2,0,32, sins, Kitty Chudleigh, Countess,1,0,17, Bristol, Duchess,1,0,38, Kingston. Miss Chudleigh, as she then,2,0,23,, believed, and who can,1,0,10, that with,1,0,28, passionate nature, her lust,1,0,7, wealth,1,0,196, property, her pistols and her parsimony, she believed with vehemence and asserted her belief with arrogance, that all General Skelton's property had legally descended to her. Later, when the will,1,0,40, read and the truth made public that not,1,0,31, the house in Henrietta Street,,1,0,100, Pap Castle in Cumberland and the lands and lead mines pertaining to it, were left without exception,1,0,144, an unknown Captain Jones, she burst out in "terms exceeding all bounds of delicacy." She cried that her relative the General was an old fool in,1,0,163, dotage, that Jones and his wife were impudent low upstarts beneath her notice, and so flounced into her coach "with a scornful quality toss" to carry on that life,1,0,7, deceit,1,0,9, intrigue,1,0,65, ambition which drove her later to wander in ignominy, an outcast,1,0,14, her country.
,1,0,15,What remains to,1,0,21, told of the fortunes,1,0,103, Captain Jones can be briefly despatched. Having new furnished the house in Henrietta Street, the Jones,1,0,48, set out when summer came to visit their estates,1,0,72, Cumberland. The country was so fair, the Castle so stately, the thought,1,0,17, now all belonged,1,0,63, them so gratifying that their progress for three weeks was one,1,0,30, unmixed pleasure and the spot,1,0,41, they were now to live seemed a paradise.,1,0,68, there was an eagerness, an impetuosity about James Jones which made,1,0,36, impatient to suffer even the smiles,1,0,41, fortune passively. He must be active —he,1,0,20, be up and doing. He,1,0,44, be "let down," for all his friends could do,1,0,9, dissuade,1,0,56,, to view a lead mine. The consequences as they foretold,1,0,12, disastrous.,1,0,10, was drawn,1,0,8,, indeed,1,0,21, but already infected,1,0,62, a deadly sickness of which in a few days he died, in the arms,2,0,19, wife, in the midst,1,0,23, that paradise which he,1,0,62, toiled so long to reach and now was to die without enjoying.
,1,0,44,Meanwhile the Wilkinsons—but that name, alas,1,0,7, was no,1,0,11, applicable,2,0,85,, nor did the Dr. and his wife any more inhabit the house in the Savoy—the Wilkinsons,1,0,33, suffered more extremities at the,2,0,33, Fate than the Joneses themselves,1,0,3, Dr,1,0,18, Wilkinson, it has,1,0,33, said, resembled his friend Jones,1,0,20, the conviviality of,1,0,25, habits and his inability,1,0,23, keep within the limits,2,0,15, income. Indeed,2,0,20, wife's dowry of two,2,0,56, had gone to pay off the debts of his youth. But by what,2,0,24, he pay off the debts of,1,0,62, middle age? He was now past fifty, and what with good company,2,0,132, living, was seldom free from duns, and always pressed for money. Suddenly, from an unexpected quarter, help appeared. This was none,2,0,48, the Marriage Act, passed in 1755, which laid it,1,0,5, that,2,0,97, person solemnized a marriage without publishing the banns, unless a marriage licence had already,1,0,31, obtained, he should be subject,1,0,38, transportation for fourteen years. Dr,1,0,90, Wilkinson, looking at the matter, it is to be feared, from his own angle, and with a view,1,0,28, his own necessities, argued,1,0,15, as Chaplain of,1,0,13, Savoy, which,1,0,79, extra-Parochial and Royal-exempt, he could grant licences as usual—a privilege,1,0,16, at once brought,1,0,12, such a glut,1,0,42, business, such a crowd of couples wishing,1,0,3, be,1,0,173, in a hurry, that the rat-tat-tat never ceased on his street door, and cash flooded the family exchequer so that even his little boy's pockets were lined with gold. The duns,1,0,43, paid; the table sumptuously spread. But Dr,1,0,101, Wilkinson shared another failing with his friend Jones; he would not take advice. His friends warned,1,0,66,; the Government plainly hinted that if he persisted they would be,2,0,35, act. Secure in what he imagined to,1,0,117, his right, enjoying the prosperity it brought him to the full, the Doctor paid no heed. On Easter Day he was engaged,1,0,23, marrying from eight in,2,0,12, till twelve,3,0,9, At last,,1,0,59, Sunday, the King's Messengers appeared. The Doctor escaped,1,0,52, a secret walk over the leads of the Savoy, made his,1,0,3, to,1,0,12, river bank,,2,0,23, slipped upon some logs,2,0,136,, heavy and elderly as he was, in the mud; but nevertheless got to Somerset stairs, took a boat, and reached the Kentish shore in safety,1,0,52, Even now he brazened it out that the law was on his,1,0,26,, and came back four weeks,1,0,128, prepared to stand his trial. Once more, for the last time, company overflowed the house in the Savoy; lawyers abounded, and, as,1,0,4, ate,3,0,11, assured Dr,1,0,10, Wilkinson,1,0,56, his case was already won. In July 1756 the trial began.,1,0,16, what conclusion,1,0,6, there,1,0,15,? The crime had,2,0,33, and persisted in openly in spite,1,0,37, warning. The Doctor was found guilty,3,0,9, fourteen,1,0,18,' transportation.
,1,0,65,It remained for his friends to fit him out, like the gentleman he,1,0,47,, for his voyage to America. There, they argued,1,0,37, his gifts of speech and person would,1,0,27, him welcome, and later his,1,0,4, and,1,0,11, could join,1,0,50,. To them he bade farewell in the dismal precincts,1,0,22, Newgate in March 1757,1,0,41, But contrary winds beat the ship back to,1,0,37,; the gout seized on a body enfeebled,1,0,9, pleasure,1,0,37, adversity; at Plymouth Dr. Wilkinson,1,0,74, transported finally and for ever. The lead mine undid Jones; the Marriage,1,0,17, was the downfall,1,0,138, Wilkinson. Both now sleep in peace, Jones in Cumberland, Wilkinson, far from his friend (and if their failings were great, great too were,1,0,32, gifts and graces) on the shores,1,0,26, the melancholy Atlantic.
,1,0,38,Shakespeareans are divided, it is well,1,0,27,, into three classes; those,1,0,7, prefer,1,0,36, read Shakespeare in the book; those,1,0,7, prefer,1,0,38, see him acted on the stage; and those,1,0,26, run perpetually from book,1,0,62, stage gathering plunder. Certainly there is a good deal to be,1,0,20, for reading Twelfth,1,0,76, in the book if the book can be read in a garden, with no sound but the thud,1,0,20, an apple falling to,1,0,7, earth,,1,0,34, of the wind ruffling the branches,1,0,4, the,1,0,9,. For one,1,0,79, there is time—time not only to hear "the sweet sound that breathes upon a bank,1,0,40, violets" but to unfold the implications,1,0,82, that very subtle speech as the Duke winds into the nature of love. There is time,,1,0,205,, to make a note in the margin; time to wonder at queer jingles like "that live in her; when liver, brain, and heart"..."and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night" and to ask oneself whether it,1,0,55, from them that was born the lovely, "And what should I,1,0,369, in Illyria? My brother he is in Elysium." For Shakespeare is writing, it seems, not with the whole of his mind mobilized and under control but with feelers left flying that sort and play with words so that the trail of a chance word is caught and followed recklessly. From the echo of one word is born another word, for which reason, perhaps, the play seems as we read,1,0,36, to tremble perpetually on the brink,1,0,52, music. They are always calling for songs in Twelfth,1,0,38,, "0 fellow come, the song we had last,1,0,44,." Yet Shakespeare was not so deeply in love,1,0,39, words but that he could turn and laugh,1,0,53, them. "They that do dally with words do quickly make,1,0,28, wanton." There is a roar of,1,0,58, and out burst Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, Maria. Words on their,1,0,124, are things that have meaning; that rush and leap out with a whole character packed in a little phrase. When Sir Andrew says,1,0,58,I was adored once," we feel that we hold him in the hollow,2,0,58, hands; a novelist would have taken three volumes to bring,1,0,14, to that pitch,1,0,10, intimacy.,1,0,24, Viola, Malvolio, Olivia,1,0,102, the Duke—the mind so brims and spills over with all that we know and guess about them as they move in,2,0,29, among the lights and shadows,2,0,36, mind's stage that we ask why should,1,0,32, imprison them within the bodies,1,0,9, real men,2,0,26,? Why exchange this garden,1,0,17, the theatre? The,2,0,37, that Shakespeare wrote for the stage,1,0,80, presumably with reason. Since they are acting Twelfth Night at the Old Vic, let,1,0,27, compare the two versions.
,1,0,120,Many apples might fall without being heard in the Waterloo Road, and as for the shadows, the electric light has consumed,1,0,4, all,1,0,65, The first impression upon entering the Old Vic is overwhelmingly,1,0,22, and definite. We seem,1,0,33, have issued out from the shadows,1,0,27, the garden upon the bridge,2,0,34, Parthenon. The metaphor is mixed,,1,0,23, then so is the scenery,1,0,87, The columns of the bridge somehow suggest an Atlantic liner and the austere splendours,1,0,71, a classical temple in combination. But the body is almost as upsetting,1,0,62, the scenery. The actual persons of Malvolio, Sir Toby, Olivia,1,0,90, the rest expand our visionary characters out of all recognition. At first we are inclined,1,0,69, resent it. You are not Malvolio; or Sir Toby either, we want to tell,1,0,1,;,1,0,32, merely impostors. We sit gaping,1,0,10, the ruins,1,0,26, the play, at the travesty,1,0,108, the play. And then by degrees this same body or rather all these bodies together, take our play and remodel,1,0,99, between them. The play gains immensely in robustness, in solidity. The printed word is changed out,1,0,86, all recognition when it is heard by other people. We watch it strike upon this man or,1,0,28,; we see them laugh or shrug,2,0,68,, or tum aside to hide their faces. The word is given a body as well,1,0,50, a soul. Then again as the actors pause, or topple,1,0,10, a barrel,,1,0,8, stretch,1,0,24, hands out, the flatness,1,0,20, the print is broken,1,0,51, as by crevasses or precipices; all the proportions,1,0,68, changed. Perhaps the most impressive effect in the play is achieved,1,0,41, the long pause which Sebastian and Viola,1,0,3, as,1,0,22, stand looking at each,1,0,49, in a silent ecstasy of recognition. The reader's,2,0,39, have slipped over that moment entirely,1,0,36, Here we are made to pause and think,1,0,21, it; and are reminded,1,0,31, Shakespeare wrote for the body,1,0,28, for the mind simultaneously,1,0,1,
,1,0,23,But now that the actors,1,0,5, done,1,0,70, proper work of solidifying and intensifying our impressions, we begin,1,0,29, criticize them more minutely,1,0,38, to compare their version with our own,1,0,11, We make Mr,1,0,67, Quartermaine's Malvolio stand beside our Malvolio. And to tell the,2,0,23, wherever the fault may,1,0,16,, they have very,1,0,3, in,1,0,4,. Mr,1,0,99, Quartermaine's Malvolio is a splendid gentleman, courteous, considerate, well bred; a man of parts,1,0,26, humour who has no quarrel,1,0,38, the world. He has never felt a twinge,1,0,7, vanity,1,0,56, a moment's envy in his life. If Sir Toby and Maria fool,1,0,84, he sees through it, we may be sure, and only suffers it as a fine gentleman puts up,1,0,48, the games of foolish children. Our Malvolio, on,4,0,66, was a fantastic complex creature, twitching with vanity, tortured,1,0,9, ambition,1,0,45, There was cruelty in his teasing, and a hint,1,0,23, tragedy in his defeat;,1,0,42, final threat had a momentary terror in it,1,0,12, But when Mr,1,0,105, Quartermaine says "I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you," we feel merely that the powers of the law,1,0,39, be soon and effectively invoked. What,,2,0,8, becomes,1,0,7, Olivia,1,0,130, "He hath been most notoriously abused"? Then there is Olivia. Madame Lopokova has by nature that rare quality which is neither to,1,0,26, had for the asking nor to,1,0,31, subdued by the will—the genius,1,0,103, personality. She has only to float on to the stage and everything round her suffers, not a sea change,,1,0,89, a change into light, into gaiety; the birds sing, the sheep are garlanded, the air rings,1,0,7, melody,1,0,32, human beings dance towards each,1,0,3, on,1,0,5, tips,3,0,49, possessed of an exquisite friendliness, sympathy,1,0,9, delight.,1,0,128, our Olivia was a stately lady; of sombre complexion, slow moving, and of few sympathies. She could not love the Duke nor change,1,0,42, feeling. Madame Lopokova loves everybody.,1,0,40, is always changing. Her hands, her face,2,0,19, feet, the whole of,2,0,97,, are always quivering in sympathy with the moment. She could make the moment, as she proved when,1,0,12, walked down,1,0,27, stairs with Sebastian, one,1,0,231, intense and moving beauty; but she was not our Olivia. Compared with her the comic group, Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, Maria, the fool were more than ordinarily English. Coarse, humorous, robust, they trolled out their words, they rolled,1,0,15, their barrels;,1,0,84, acted magnificently. No reader, one may make bold to say, could outpace Miss Seyler,1,0,46, Maria, with its quickness, its inventiveness,,1,0,43, merriment; nor add anything to the humours,1,0,3, Mr,1,0,8, Livesey,1,0,59, Sir Toby. And Miss jeans as Viola was satisfactory; and Mr,1,0,38, Hare as Antonio was admirable; and Mr,1,0,45, Morland's clown was a good clown. What, then,1,0,29, was lacking in the play as a,1,0,48,? Perhaps that it was not a whole. The fault may,1,0,7, partly,1,0,26, Shakespeare. It is easier,1,0,15, act his comedy,2,0,64, poetry, one may suppose, for when he wrote as a poet he was apt,2,0,48, too quick for the human tongue. The prodigality,1,0,14, his metaphors,1,0,28, be flashed over by the eye,,1,0,67, the speaking voice falters in the middle. Hence the comedy was out,1,0,11, proportion,1,0,154, the rest. Then, perhaps, the actors were too highly charged with individuality or too incongruously cast. They broke the play up into separate pieces—now,1,0,61, were in the groves of Arcady, now in some inn at Blackfriars,1,0,43, The mind in reading spins a web from scene,2,0,254,, compounds a background from apples falling, and the toll of a church bell, and an owl's fantastic flight which keeps the play together. Here that continuity was sacrificed. We left the theatre possessed of many brilliant fragments but without the sense,1,0,85, all things conspiring and combining together which may be the satisfying culmination,1,0,43, a less brilliant performance. Nevertheless,1,0,24, the play has served its,1,0,4,. It,1,0,29, made us compare our Malvolio,1,0,3, Mr,1,0,13, Quartermaine,1,0,74,; our Olivia with Madame Lopokova's; our reading of the whole play with Mr,1,0,45, Guthrie's; and since they all differ back we,1,0,22, go to Shakespeare. We,1,0,13, read Twelfth,1,0,10, again. Mr,1,0,48, Guthrie has made that necessary and whetted our,2,0,32, The Cherry Orchard, Measure for,1,0,31,, and Henry the Eighth that are,1,0,3, to,1,0,2,.
,1,0,55,This great lady, this robust and fertile letter writer,,1,0,40, in our age would probably have been one,1,0,44, the great novelists, takes up presumably as,2,0,99, in the consciousness of living readers as any figure of her vanished age. But it is more difficult,1,0,49, fix that figure within an outline than so to sum,1,0,43, many of her contemporaries. That is partly,2,0,42, created her being, not in plays or poems,,2,0,17, letters—touch by,1,0,86,, with repetitions, amassing daily trifles, writing down what came into her head as if,1,0,169, were talking. Thus the fourteen volumes of her letters enclose a vast open space, like one of her own great woods; the rides are crisscrossed with the intricate shadows,1,0,112, branches, figures roam down the glades, pass from sun to shadow, are lost to sight, appear again, but never sit,1,0,40, in fixed attitudes to compose a group.
,1,0,12,Thus we live,1,0,135, her presence, and often fall, as with living people, into unconsciousness. She goes on talking, we half listen. And then something she,1,0,39, rouses us. We add it to her character,,1,0,90, that the character grows and changes, and she seems like a living person, inexhaustible.
,1,0,7,This of,1,0,7, is one,1,0,14, the qualities,1,0,48, all letter writers possess, and she, because of,1,0,24, unconscious naturalness,1,0,112, her flow and abundance, possesses it far more than the brilliant Walpole, for example, or the reserved and self,1,0,35,conscious Gray. Perhaps in the long,1,0,49, we know her more instinctively, more profoundly,,1,0,34, we know them. We sink deeper down,1,0,33, her, and know by instinct rather,1,0,53, by reason how she will feel; this she will be amused,1,0,47,; that will take her fancy; now she will plunge,1,0,36, melancholy. Her range too is larger,1,0,65, theirs; there is more scope and more diversity. Everything seems,1,0,110, yield its juice—its fun, its enjoyment; or to feed her meditations. She has a robust appetite; nothing shocks,1,0,1,;,1,0,17, gets nourishment,1,0,16, whatever is set,3,0,265, She is an intellectual, quick to enjoy the wit of La Rochefoucauld, to relish the fine discrimination of Madame de La Fayette. She has a natural dwelling place in books, so that Josephus or Pascal or the absurd long romances of the time are not read by her so much,1,0,12, embedded in,1,0,57, mind. Their verses, their stories rise to her lips along,2,0,44, own thoughts. But there is a sensibility in,1,0,38, which intensifies this great appetite,1,0,5, many,1,0,10,. It is of,1,0,60, shown at its most extreme, its most irrational, in her love,2,0,9, daughter,1,0,10, She loves,1,0,54, as an elderly man loves a young mistress who tortures,1,0,4,. It,1,0,90, a passion that was twisted and morbid; it caused her many humiliations; sometimes it made,1,0,8, ashamed,2,0,32,. For, from the daughter's point,2,0,53, it was exhausting, was embarrassing to be the object,2,0,89, intense emotion; and she could not always respond. She feared that her mother was making,1,0,23, ridiculous in the eyes,1,0,32, her friends. Also she felt that,1,0,19, was not like that.,1,0,109, was different; colder, more fastidious, less robust. Her mother was ignoring the real daughter in this flood,1,0,25, adoration for a daughter,1,0,4, did,1,0,22, exist. She was forced,1,0,5, curb,1,0,11,; to assert,1,0,17, own identity. It,1,0,11, inevitable,1,0,24, Madame de Sévigné, with,1,0,44, exacerbated sensibility, should feel hurt.
,1,0,20,Sometimes, therefore,1,0,43, Madame de Sévigné weeps. The daughter does,1,0,5, love,1,0,41,. That is a thought so bitter, and a fear,1,0,27, perpetual and so profound,,1,0,11, life loses,1,0,25, savour; she has recourse,1,0,97, sages, to poets to console her; and reflects with sadness upon the vanity of life; and how death,2,0,11,. Then, too,1,0,95, she is agitated beyond what is right or reasonable, because a letter has not reached her. Then,1,0,11, knows that,1,0,61, has been absurd; and realizes that she is boring her friends,1,0,45, this obsession. What is worse, she has bored,1,0,225, daughter. And then when the bitter drop has fallen, up bubbles quicker and quicker the ebullition of that robust vitality, of that irrepressible quick enjoyment, that natural relish for life, as if she instinctively repaired,1,0,94, failure by fluttering all her feathers; by making every facet glitter. She shakes herself out,2,0,18, glooms; makes fun,1,0,41, "les D'Hacquevilles"; collects a handful,1,0,87, gossip; the latest news of the King and Madame de Maintenon; how Charles has fallen in,1,0,1,;,1,0,132, the ridiculous Mademoiselle de Plessis has been foolish again; when she wanted a handkerchief to spit into, the silly woman tweaked,1,0,23, nose; or describes how,1,0,17, has been amusing,1,0,34, by amazing the simple little girl,1,0,17, lives at the end,2,0,47, park— la petite personne—with stories of kings,1,0,74, countries, of all that great world that she who has lived in the thick of,1,0,56, knows so well. At last, comforted, assured for the time,1,0,25, at least of her daughter,1,0,68, love, she lets herself relax; and throwing off all disguises, tells,1,0,28, daughter how nothing in the,1,0,8, pleases,1,0,21, so well as solitude.,1,0,34, is happiest alone in the country.,1,0,24, loves rambling alone in,1,0,7, woods.,1,0,19, loves going out by,1,0,3, at,1,0,32,. She loves hiding from callers.,1,0,30, loves walking among her trees,1,0,31, musing. She loves the gardener,1,0,9, chatter;,2,0,72, planting. She loves the gipsy girl who dances, as her own daughter used,1,0,42, dance, but not of course so exquisitely.
,1,0,47,It is natural to use the present tense, because,1,0,5, live,1,0,13, her presence,1,0,29, We are very little conscious,1,0,57, a disturbing medium between us—that she is living, after,1,0,10,, by means,1,0,15, written words.,1,0,8, now and,1,0,15, with the sound,2,0,13, voice in our,1,0,26, and its rhythm rising and,1,0,143, within us, we become aware, with some sudden phrase, about spring, about a country neighbour, something struck off in a flash, that we are, of,2,0,16, being addressed,1,0,4, one,1,0,44, the great mistresses of the art of speech.
,1,0,54,Then we listen for a time, consciously. How, we wonder,1,0,18, does she contrive,1,0,94, make us follow every word of the story of the cook who killed himself because the fish failed,1,0,72, come in time for the royal dinner party; or the scene of the haymaking;,1,0,13, the anecdote,2,0,66, servant whom she dismissed in a sudden rage; how does she achieve,1,0,117, order, this perfection of composition? Did she practise her art? It seems not. Did she tear up and correct? There is,1,0,7, record,2,0,42, painstaking or effort. She says again and,3,0,52, writes her letters as she speaks. She begins one as,1,0,147, sends off another; there is the page on her desk and she fills it, in the intervals of all her other avocations. People are interrupting; servants,1,0,7, coming,1,0,24, orders. She entertains;,1,0,15, is at the beck,4,0,23, friends. It seems then,2,0,5, must,1,0,15, been so imbued,1,0,33, good sense, by the age she lived,1,0,59,, by the company she kept—La Rochefoucauld's wisdom, Madame,1,0,91, La Fayette's conversation, by hearing now a play by Racine, by reading Montaigne, Rabelais,1,0,39, or Pascal; perhaps by sermons, perhaps,1,0,20, some of those songs,1,0,38, Coulanges was always singing—she must,1,0,11, imbibed so,1,0,14, that was sane,1,0,47, wholesome unconsciously that, when she took up,2,0,40,, it followed unconsciously the laws she,1,0,16, learnt by heart,1,0,67, Marie de Rabutin it seems was born into a group where the elements,1,0,64, so richly and happily mixed that it drew out her virtue instead,1,0,12, opposing it,1,0,29, She was helped, not thwarted,1,0,63, Nothing baffled or contracted or withered her. What opposition,1,0,12, encountered,1,0,12, only enough,1,0,8, confirm,1,0,39, judgment. For she was highly conscious,1,0,30, folly, of vice, of pretention,1,0,171, She was a born critic, and a critic whose judgments were inborn, unhesitating. She is always referring her impressions to a standard—hence the incisiveness, the depth and,1,0,86, comedy that make those spontaneous statements so illuminating. There is nothing naive,1,0,5, her.,1,0,9, is by no,1,0,55, a simple spectator. Maxims fall from her pen. She sums,1,0,85,; she judges. But it is done effortlessly. She has inherited the standard and accepts,1,0,15, without effort,1,0,12, She is heir,1,0,81, a tradition, which stands guardian and gives proportion. The gaiety, the colour,,1,0,9, chatter,,1,0,155, many movements of the figures in the foreground have a background. At Les Rochers there is always Paris and the court; at Paris there is Les Rochers, with,1,0,10, solitude,,1,0,7, trees,,1,0,9, peasants,1,0,11, And behind,1,0,48, all again there is virtue, faith, death itself.,1,0,68, this background, while it gives its scale to the moment, is so well,2,0,15, she is secure.,1,0,46, is free, thus anchored, to explore; to enjoy;,1,0,20, plunge this way and,1,0,25,; to enter wholeheartedly,1,0,41, the myriad humours, pleasures, oddities,,1,0,8, savours,1,0,60, her well nourished, prosperous, delightful present moment.
,1,0,51,So she passes with free and stately step from Paris,1,0,23, Brittany from Brittany,1,0,60, her coach and six all across France. She stays with friends,1,0,10, the road;,1,0,12, is attended,1,0,19, a cheerful company,1,0,53, familiars. Wherever she alights she attracts at once,1,0,20, love of some boy or,1,0,1,;,1,0,90, the exacting admiration of a man of the world like her disagreeable cousin Bussy Rabutin,,1,0,58, cannot rest under her disapproval, but must be assured of,1,0,22, good opinion in spite,1,0,95, all his treachery. The famous and the brilliant also wish to have her company, for she is part,1,0,117, their world; and can take her share in their sophisticated conversations. There is something wise and large and sane,2,0,28, which draws the confidences,1,0,22, her own son. Feckless,1,0,10, impulsive,1,0,107, the prey of his own weak and charming nature as he is, Charles nurses her with the utmost patience through,1,0,10, rheumatic,1,0,1,.,1,0,7, laughs,1,0,49, his foibles; knows his failings. She is tolerant,1,0,24, outspoken; nothing need,1,0,7, hidden,1,0,4, her,2,0,21, knows all that there,2,0,3, be,1,0,26, of man and his passions.
,1,0,20,So she takes her way,2,0,17, world, and sends,1,0,72, letters, radiant and glowing with all this various traffic from one end,1,0,7, France,3,0,14,, twice weekly,1,0,67, As the fourteen volumes so spaciously unfold their story of twenty,1,0,34, it seems that this world is large,1,0,105, to enclose everything. Here is the garden that Europe has been digging for many centuries; into which so,1,0,24, generations have poured,1,0,21, blood; here it is at,1,0,119, fertilized, bearing flowers. And the flowers are not those rare and solitary blossoms—great men, with their poems, and,1,0,31, conquests. The flowers in this,1,0,42, are a whole society of full grown men and,1,0,113, from whom want and struggle have been removed; growing together in harmony, each contributing something that the,1,0,6, lacks,1,0,7, By way,1,0,62, proving it, the letters of Madame de Sévigné are often shared,1,0,112, other pens; now her son takes up the pen; the Abbé adds his paragraph; even the simple girl— la petite personne,1,0,24,is not afraid to pipe up,1,0,38, the same page. The month of May, 1678,1,0,69, at Les Rochers in Brittany, thus echoes with different voices. There,1,0,46, the birds singing; Pilois is planting; Madame,1,0,112, Sévigné roams the woods alone; her daughter is entertaining politicians in Provence; not very far away Monsieur,1,0,25, Rochefoucauld is engaged,1,0,179, telling the truth with Madame de La Fayette to prune his words; Racine is finishing the play which soon they will all be hearing together; and discussing afterwards with the King,1,0,69, that lady whom in the private language of their set they call Quanto,1,0,19, The voices mingle;,1,0,81, are all talking together in the garden in 1678. But what was happening outside?
,1,0,103,If at this moment there is little chance of re-reading the sixteen volumes of the Paget Toynbee edition,1,0,8, Walpole,1,0,28, letters, while the prospect,1,0,70, possessing the magnificent Yale edition, where all the letters are to,1,0,101, printed with all the answers, becomes remote, this sound and sober biography of Horace Walpole by Mr,1,0,27, Ketton-Cremer may serve at,1,0,76, to inspire some random thoughts about Walpole and the humane art which owes,1,0,7, origin,1,0,9, the love,1,0,10, friends.
,1,0,14,But, according,2,0,18, latest biographer,1,0,66, Horace Walpole's letters were inspired not by the love of friends,3,0,5, love,1,0,45, posterity. He had meant to write the history,2,0,24, own times. After twenty,1,0,11, he gave it,1,0,35,, and decided to write another kind,1,0,10, history—a,1,0,20, ostensibly inspired,1,0,93, friends but in fact written for posterity. Thus Mann stood for politics; Gray for literature,1,0,24, Montagu and Lady Ossory,1,0,96, society. They were pegs, not friends, each chosen because he was "particularly connected...with,2,0,35, the subjects about which he wished,1,0,51, enlighten and inform posterity." But if we believe,1,0,15, Horace Walpole,1,0,72, a historian in disguise, we are denying his peculiar genius as a letter,1,0,12,. The letter,1,0,20, is no surreptitious,1,0,72,. He is a man of short range sensibility; he speaks not to the public at,3,0,43, the individual in private. All good letter,1,0,14, feel the drag,1,0,9, the face,1,0,10, the other,3,0,37, age and obey it—they take as much as,1,0,25, give. And Horace Walpole,1,0,3, no,2,0,47, There is the correspondence with Cole to prove,1,0,8,. We can,1,0,7,, in Mr,1,0,6, Lewis,1,0,71, edition, how the Tory parson develops the radical and the free-thinker,1,0,25, Walpole, how the middle-,1,0,79, professional man brings to the surface the aristocrat and the amateur. If Cole,1,0,35, been nothing but a peg there would,2,0,8, none of,1,0,11, echo, none,2,0,31, mingling of voices. It is true,1,0,86, Walpole had an attitude and a style, and that his letters have a fine hard glaze upon,1,0,26, that preserves them, like,1,0,79, teeth of which he was so proud, from the little dents and rubs of familiarity.,1,0,3, of,1,0,18,—did he not insist,2,0,13, letters must,1,0,31, kept?—he sometimes looked over,1,0,118, page at the distant horizon, as Madame de Sévigné, whom he worshipped, did too, and imagined other people in times to,1,0,54, reading him. But that he allowed the featureless face,1,0,10, posterity,1,0,18, stand between him,1,0,45, the very voice and dress of his friends, how,1,0,11, looked and,2,0,37, thought, the letters themselves with,1,0,190, perpetual variety deny. Open them at random. He is writing about politics—about Wilkes and Chatham and the signs of coming revolution in France; but also about a snuffbox; and a red riband;,1,0,100, about two very small black dogs. Voices upon the stairs interrupt him; more sightseers have come to,1,0,14, Caligula with,1,0,61, silver eyes; a spark from the fire has burnt the page he was,1,0,39,; he cannot keep the pompous, style any,1,0,46,, nor mend a careless phrase, and so, flexible,1,0,52, an eel, he winds from high politics to living faces,1,0,35, the past and its memories——"I tell,1,0,46, we should get together, and comfort ourselves,1,0,104, the brave days that we have known...I wished for you; the same scenes strike us both, and the same kind,1,0,32, visions has amused us both ever,1,0,114, we were born." It is not thus that a man writes when his correspondent is a peg and he is thinking of posterity.
,1,0,73,Nor again was he thinking of the great public, which, in a very few years,1,0,31, would have paid him handsomely,1,0,20, the brilliant pages,1,0,12, he lavished,1,0,17, his friends. Was,1,0,1,,,2,0,11, the growth,1,0,18, writing as a paid,1,0,56,, and the change which that change of focus brought with,1,0,28, that led, in the nineteenth,3,0,12, the decline,1,0,48, this humane art? Friendship flourished, nor was,2,0,5, lack,1,0,56, gift. Who could have described a party more brilliantly,1,0,56, Macaulay or a landscape more exquisitely than Tennyson?,2,0,19,, looking them full,1,0,33, the face was the present moment—,1,0,25, great gluttonous public;,1,0,220, how can a writer turn at will from that impersonal stare to the little circle in the fire-lit room? Macaulay, writing to his sister, can no more drop his public manner than an actress can scrub her cheeks clean of paint,1,0,28, take her place naturally at,1,0,4, tea,1,0,19,. And Tennyson with,1,0,135, fear of publicity—"While I live the owls, when I die the ghouls"—left nothing more succulent for the ghoul to feed upon than a handful,1,0,30, dry little notes that anybody,1,0,34, read, or print or put under glass,1,0,38, a museum. News and gossip, the sticks,1,0,11, straws out,2,0,144, the old letter writer made his nest, have been snatched away. The wireless and the telephone have intervened. The letter writer has nothing now,1,0,75, build with except what is most private; and how monotonous after a page or,1,0,88, the intensity of the very private becomes! We long that Keats even should cease to talk,1,0,62, Fanny, and that Elizabeth and Robert Browning should slam the,1,0,38, of the sick room and take a breath of,2,0,23, in an omnibus. Instead,1,0,49, letters posterity will have confessions, diaries,1,0,24, notebooks, like M. Gide,1,0,16,—hybrid books in,1,0,4, the,1,0,70, talks in the dark to himself about himself for a generation yet to be,1,0,2,.
,1,0,28,Horace Walpole suffered none,1,0,58, these drawbacks. If he was the greatest of English letter,1,0,23, it was not only thanks,1,0,17, his gifts but to,1,0,13, immense good,1,0,28,. He had his places to begin,1,0,70,—an income of £2,500 dropped yearly into his mouth from Collectorships,1,0,93, Usherships and was swallowed without a pang. "...nor can I think myself," he wrote serenely,,1,0,181,as a placeman a more useless or a less legal engrosser of part of the wealth of the nation than deans and prebendaries"—indeed the money was well invested. But besides those places,,1,0,43, was the other—his place in the very centre,1,0,117, the audience, facing the stage. There he could sit and see without being seen; contemplate without being called upon,1,0,11, act. Above,1,0,61, he was blessed in his little public—a circle that surrounded,1,0,26, with that warm climate in,1,0,64, he could live the life of incessant changes which is the breath,1,0,45, a letter writer's existence. Besides the wit,1,0,17, the anecdote and,1,0,38, brilliant descriptions of masquerades,1,0,36, midnight revelries his friends drew,1,0,106, him something superficial yet profound, something changing yet entire—himself shall we call it in default,1,0,139, one word for that which friends elicit but the great public kills? From that sprang his immortality. For a self that goes on changing is a,2,0,5, goes,1,0,66, living. As an historian he would have stagnated among historians.,1,0,93, as a letter writer he buffets his way among the crowd, holding out a hand to each generation,1,0,13, turn—laughed,1,0,12,, criticized,1,0,39, despised, admired, but always in touch,1,0,50, the living. When Macaulay met him in October 1833,1,0,36, he struck that hand away in a burst,1,0,10, righteous,1,0,11,. "His mind,1,0,9, a bundle,1,0,17, inconstant whims,1,0,27, affectations. His features,1,0,53, covered by mask within mask." His letters, like paté,1,0,10, foie gras,1,0,24, owed their excellence ",1,0,75, the diseases of the wretched animal which furnishes it"— such was Macaulay,1,0,14, greeting. And,1,0,37, greater boon can any writer ask than,1,0,12, be trounced,1,0,62, Lord Macaulay? We take the reputation he has gored, repair it,1,0,81, give it another spin and another direction—another lease of life. Opinion, as Mr,1,0,19, Ketton-Cremer says,1,0,134, is always changing about Walpole. "The present age looks upon him with a more friendly eye" than the last. Is it that the present age,1,0,19, deafened with boom,1,0,34, blatancy? Does it hear in Walpole,1,0,62, low tones things that are more interesting, more penetrating,,1,0,14, true than can,1,0,98, said by the loud speakers? Certainly there is something wonderful to the present age in the sight,1,0,21, a whole human being—,1,0,25, a man so blessed that he,1,0,44, unfold every gift, every foible, whose long,1,0,44, spreads like a great lake reflecting houses,1,0,8, friends,1,0,5, wars,1,0,12, snuff boxes,1,0,12, revolutions,1,0,80, lap dogs, the great and the little, all intermingled, and behind them a stretch,1,0,38, the serene blue sky. "Nor will [death,1,0,30, I think see me very unwilling,1,0,100, go with him, though I have no disappointments, but I came into the world so early, and have seen so,1,0,32, that I am satisfied." Satisfied,1,0,22, his life in the flesh,1,0,38, he could be still more satisfied with,1,0,62, life in the spirit. Even now he is being collected and pieced,1,0,28,, letter and answer, himself,1,0,138, the reflections of himself, so that whoever else may die, Horace Walpole is immortal. Whatever ruin may befall the map of Europe in years,2,0,7,, there,1,0,6, still,1,0,66, people, it is consoling to reflect, to hang absorbed over the map,1,0,17, one human face.
,1,0,53,Since to criticize the Yale edition of Horace Walpole,1,0,8, letters,1,0,80, Cole is impossible, for there cannot in the whole universe exist a single human,1,0,165, whose praise or blame of such minute and monumental learning can be of any value—if such exists his knowledge has been tapped already—the only course for the reader,2,0,12, say nothing,1,0,44, the learning and the industry, the devotion,1,0,97, the skill which have created these two huge volumes, and to record merely such fleeting thoughts,1,0,76, have formed in the mind from a single reading. To encourage our selves, let,1,0,15, assert, though,1,0,24, with entire confidence,,1,0,28, books after all exist to be,1,0,47,—even the most learned of editors would to some,1,0,3, at,1,0,6, agree,1,0,6, that.,1,0,30, how, the question immediately,1,0,5,, can,1,0,5, read,1,0,91, magnificent instalment—for these are but the first two volumes of this edition in which Mr,1,0,175, Lewis will give us the complete correspondence—of our old friend Horace Walpole's letters? Ought not the presses to have issued in a supplementary pocket a supplementary pair,1,0,124, eyes? Then, with the usual pair fixed upon the text, the additional pair could range the notes, thus sweeping together into,1,0,29, haul not only what Horace is,1,0,25, to Cole and what Cole is,1,0,27, to Horace, but a multitude,1,0,35, minor men and matters: for example,1,0,15, Thomas Farmer,,1,0,100, ran away and left two girls with child; Thomas Wood, who was never drunk but had a bad constitution,1,0,116, was therefore left fifty pounds and bed and furniture in Cole's will; Cole's broken leg, how it was broken, and why,1,0,25, was badly mended; Birch,,2,0,15, (it is thought,1,0,58, an apoplectic fit riding in the Hampstead Road, fell from,1,0,43, horse, and died; Thomas Western (1695-1754,2,0,8, was one,1,0,20, the pall-bearers at,1,0,8, funeral,1,0,42, Cole's father; Cole's niece, the daughter,1,0,68, a wholesale cheesemonger; John Woodyer, a man of placid disposition,1,0,19, great probity; Mrs,1,0,15, Allen Hopkins,,1,0,56, was born Mary Thornhill; and, Lord Montfort, who—but if,1,0,5, want,1,0,10, know more,1,0,25, that nobleman, his lions,3,0,41, his "high-spirited and riotous behaviour,1,0,16, we must look it,1,0,4, for,1,0,36, in the Harwicke mss. in the British,1,0,7,. There,1,0,18, limits even to Mr,1,0,8, Lewis.
,1,0,44,This little haul, taken at random, is enough,1,0,69, show how great a strain the new method of editing lays upon the eye.,2,0,31, the brain is at first inclined,1,0,62, jib at such perpetual solicitations, and to beg to be allowed,1,0,163, read the text in peace, it adjusts itself by degrees; grudgingly admits that many of these little facts are to the point; and finally becomes not merely a convert,1,0,34, a suppliant—asks not for less but,1,0,9, more and,1,0,4, and,1,0,14,. Why, to take,1,0,18, instance only, is,1,0,9, the name,1,0,5, Cole,1,0,117, temporary cook's sister divulged? Thomas Wood was his servant; Thomas was left fifty pounds and allowed Cole's coach,1,0,27, run away; Thomas's younger,1,0,13, James, known,1,0,94, "Jem," ran errands successfully and had a child ready to be sworn to him; their sister, Molly,1,0,65, was for one month at least a cook and helped in the kitchen. But,1,0,24, was another sister and,,1,0,13, learning all,1,0,78, the Woods, it is positively painful not to know at least her Christian name.
,1,0,38,Yet it may be asked, what has the name,1,0,62, Cole's cook's sister got to do with Horace Walpole? That is a,1,0,23, which it is impossible,2,0,9, briefly;,1,0,26, it is proof of the editor,1,0,26, triumph, justification of,1,0,8, system,,1,0,23, a complete vindication,1,0,66, his immense labour that he has convinced us, long before the end,,1,0,11, somehow or,1,0,13, it all hangs,1,0,41,. The only way to read letters is to read,1,0,54, thus stereoscopically. Horace is partly Cole; Cole is,1,0,7, Horace,2,0,58,'s cook is partly Cole; therefore Horace Walpole is partly,2,0,49, cook's sister. Horace, the whole Horace, is made,2,0,18, innumerable facts,1,0,71, reflections of facts. Each is infinitely minute; yet each is essential,1,0,37, the other. To elicit them and relate,1,0,7, is out,1,0,4, the,2,0,13, Let us, then,1,0,18, concentrate for a,1,0,40, upon the two main figures, in outline.
,1,0,18,We have here, then,1,0,80, in conjunction the Honourable Horace Walpole and the Reverend William Cole. But,1,0,14, were two very,1,0,76, people. Cole, it is true, had been at Eton with Horace, where he was called,1,0,58, the famous Walpole group "Tozhy," but he was not a member,2,0,43, group, and socially he was greatly Walpole,1,0,21, inferior. His father,1,0,19, a farmer, Horace's,1,0,4, was,1,0,6, Prime,1,0,14,. Cole's niece,1,0,13, the daughter,1,0,149, a cheesemonger; Horace's niece married a Prince of the Blood Royal. But Cole was a man of solid good sense who made no bones of this disparity, and,,1,0,27, leaving Eton and Cambridge,1,0,103, he had become, in his quiet frequently flooded parsonage, one of the first antiquaries of the time. It,1,0,20, this common passion,1,0,24, brought the two friends,1,0,8, again.
,1,0,8,For some,1,0,36,, obscurely hidden in the psychology,1,0,33, the human race, the middle years,1,0,16, that eighteenth,1,0,39, which seems now a haven of bright calm,1,0,57, serene civilization, affected some who actually lived in,1,0,49, with a longing to escape—from its politics, from,1,0,6, wars,,2,0,9, follies,,2,0,50, drabness and its dullness, to the superior charms,1,0,11, the Middle,2,0,32, "I...hope," wrote Cole in 1765,,1,0,17,by the latter end,2,0,65, week to be among my admired friends of the twelfth or thirteenth,1,0,150,. Indeed you judge very right concerning my indifference about what is going forward in the world, where I live in it as though I was no way concerned,1,0,139, it except in paying, with my contemporaries, the usual taxes and impositions. In good truth I am very indifferent about my Lord Bute or Mr,1,0,53, Pitt, as I have long been convinced and satisfied in,1,0,4, own,2,0,41, all oppositions are from the ins and the,1,0,20,, and that power and,1,0,12, and dignity,1,0,26, the things struggled for,,1,0,123, the good of the whole...I hope what I have said will not be offensive." Only one weekly newspaper, the Cambridge Chronicle,1,0,152, brought him news of the present moment. There at Bletchley or at Milton he sat secluded, wrapped up from the least draught, for he was terribly subject,1,0,85, sore throats; sometimes issuing forth to conduct a service, for he was, incidentally,1,0,57, a clergyman; driving occasionally to Cambridge to hobnob,1,0,34, his cronies; but always returning,1,0,8, delight,1,0,17, his study, where,1,0,32, copied maps, filled in coats of,1,0,23,, and pored assiduously,1,0,56, those budgets of old manuscripts which were, as he said,1,0,23, "wife and children" to,1,0,22,. Now and again, it is,1,0,43,, he looked out of the window at the antics,1,0,41, his dog, for whose future he was careful,1,0,123, provide, or at those guinea fowl whose eggs he begged off Horace—for "I have so few amusements and can see these creatures,1,0,27, my study window when I can,1,0,12, stir out of,1,0,8, room."
